    "content": "To the Honorable the Judges of the Circuit Court of the District of New York: We have been summoned to appear, on the 14th day of this month, before a special circuit court of the United States for the district of New York, to testify on the part of William S. Smith and Samuel G. Ogden, severally, in certain issues of traverse between the United States and the said William S. Smith and Samuel G. Ogden. Sensible of all the attention due to the writs of subpoena issued in these cases, it is with regret we have to state to the court, that the president of the United States, taking into view the state of our public affairs, has specially signified to us that our official duties cannot, consistently therewith, be at this juncture dispensed with. The court, we trust, will be pleased to accept this as a satisfactory explanation of our failure to give the personal attendance required. And as it must be uncertain whether, at any subsequent period, the absence of heads of departments, at such a distance from the scene of their official duties, may not equally happen to interfere with them, we respectfully submit, whether the objects of the parties in this case may not be reconciled with public considerations by a commission issued, with the consent of their counsel and that of the district attorney of the United States, for the purpose of taking, in that mode, our respective testimonies. We have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your most obedient servants. James Madison. H. Dearborne. R. Smith. City of Washington, 8th of July, 1806."

    "content": "George F. Seward March 3, 1879. Ordered to be printed. MR. BUTLER, from the Committee on the Judiciary, submitted the following REPORT: The Committee on the Judiciary, to whom was referred the matter of alleged contempt of George F. Seward, having considered the matter referred to them, beg leave to report: The principal question submitted to the Committee on the Judiciary by the House, although of little practical importance to the case in which it arose, owing to the near close of the session, yet is of so much gravity as a precedent involving the constitutional rights of the citizen as to merit a much more extended investigation than it has been possible to give it in the time permitted to us. The committee would therefore state rather the conclusions to which they came than the arguments and authorities by which those conclusions might well be supported. The facts necessary to raise the question succinctly state themselves in this way: By resolution of the House the Committee on Expenditures in the State Department were in charge of the investigation of the official conduct of George F. Seward, late consul-general of the United Sates in China, and now minister resident there. Mr. Seward came before the committee, appeared by counsel; charges were filed against him for sundry malfeasances in office, looking to his impeachment, if proven; and evidence was taken to sustain such charges. The committee deemed it important that they should have before them certain books kept by him while such consul-general, and which, it was claimed, showed entries tending to substantiate the accusations. There was evidence before the committee tending to show that those books were the public records of the consulate, and the property of the United States. Mr. Seward claimed that they were books in which he kept his governmental and his private transactions for his personal use, and that he had returned to the State Department or left in the consulate all the books of the United States. The committee procured a subpoena duces tecum directed to him, which was served on Mr. Seward, commanding him to produce these books for the purpose of being used in evidence against him. Mr. Seward appeared in obedience to the subpoena, but declined to be sworn as a witness in a case where crime was alleged against him, and where articles of impeachment might be found against him, claiming, through his counsel, his constitutional privilege of not being obliged to produce evidence in a criminal case tending to criminal himself. Upon this refusal, the Committee on Expenditures in the State Department brought Mr. Seward before the House to show cause at its bar why he should not be sworn as a witness, and why he should not obey [*2] the order of the House, through it subpoena, to produce the documentary evidence called for. Mr. Seward, when before the House, in answer to the question of the Speaker, set up practically the same claim that he did before the committee. Upon a resolution proposed by the minority of such committee, the question was referred by a vote of the House to its Judiciary Committee as to whether the cause shown by Mr. Seward for not obeying the subpoena of the House and declining to be sworn as a witness was a sufficient answer. Investigations looking to the impeachment of public officers have always been finally examined before the Judiciary Committee of the House, so far as we are instructed; and it is believed that the case cannot be found as a precedent where the party charged has ever been called upon and compelled to give evidence in such case. We distinguish this case from the case of an ordinary investigation for legislative purposes, where all parties are called upon to give such evidence (oral or written) as may tend to throw light upon the subject of investigation; but even in those cases it was early held that a person called as a witness, and not a party charged before the committee, was not bound to criminate himself; and a statute familiar to the House, for the protection of witnesses under such circumstances, from having the evidence given, used against them, was passed. In making an investigation of the facts charged against an officer of thee United Sates looking to impeachment, the House acts as the grand inquest of the nation to present that officer for trial before the highest court known to our Constitution, the Senate of the United States, for such punishment as may be constitutionally imposed upon him, which is very severe in its penalties, and even then does not exonerate the party from further prosecution before the proper courts for offenses against the laws. If these books of Mr. Seward’s are his private books, kept for his personal use, or whether they contain records of his action as a public officer intermixed or otherwise with his private transactions, it is believed he cannot be compelled to produce them. A public officer may well keep a duplicate set of records of his transactions as such for his own use and protection, and he may, at his will, mingle therewith his own private transactions; and as a party to a contestation between the United States and himself, looking to his trial and punishment for alleged criminal transactions, he cannot be compelled to produce such books nor answer concerning them, but he is protected by the constitutional provision (which is, after all, only a translation of a clause of Magna Charta), and which is a distinguishing characteristic of criminal procedure at common law in England, as opposed to criminal procedure by the civil law in other European states. Even if he had possessed himself of public records which contained evidence to accuse him of crime in such a contestation (which makes a criminal case), it seems to your committee the question would be more than doubtful whether he could be called upon to produce such books. A subpoena duces tecum is not the remedy of the government. If he has embezzled or stolen the books, he may he proceeded against criminally therefor. If he refuses to produce them to his superior officer who has a right to call for them public books, then they may be got out of his hands by writ of replevin or other proper process. If the question in whom is the title to these books would be the test as to the question whether the accused himself were obliged to produce them as evidence against himself, then a question would at the outset [*3] arise, how is title to be tried? If the books are private, they are not to be produced. Can a man’s title to his private property be tried and decided against him collaterally so as to deprive the accused of his rights? Your committee believe that it cannot. If, as the Committee on Expenditures in the State Department believe, these are public books, then it seems very clear to your committee that that committee have mistaken the proper procedure in court of justice. Their subpoena duces tecum should be issued to the highest executive officer having charge, custody, and control of such public records. Since the case of Burr, where subpoena duces tecum was demanded of the court by the defendant against Thomas Jefferson, then President of the United States—and the right to have such writ issued was determined by the Chief Justice—to have certain letter, known as “the Wilkinson letter,” then on the files of the State Department, produced, the usual course has been for committee of Congress to direct letter to the head of the proper department, or the House, by resolution, to call upon the proper executive officer, to produce the same, leaving that officer to get possession of the books from his subordinate by any lawful means. But it may be asked, cannot the House direct subpoena to any executive officer of the departments to produce any books actually in his possession in the course of official duty, and bring them before the House for the purpose of information or to aid an inquiry? Certainly that can be done, and, in proper cases, ought to be done; but, in contemplation of law, under our theory of government, all the records of the executive departments are under the control of the President of the United States; and, although the House sometimes sends resolutions to head of a department to produce such books or papers, yet it is conceived that, in any doubtful case, no head of department would bring before committee of the House any of the records of his office without permission of, or consultation with his superior, the President of the United States; and all resolutions directed to the President of the United States to produce papers within the control of the Executive, if properly drawn, contain a clause, “if in his judgment not inconsistent with the public interest.” And whenever the President has returned (as sometimes he has) that, in his judgment, it was not consistent with the public interest to give the House such information, no further proceedings have ever been taken to compel the production of such information. Indeed, upon principle, it would seem that this must be so. The Executive is as independent of either house of Congress as either house of Congress is independent of him, and they cannot call for the records of his action or the action of his officers against his consent, any more than he can call for any of the journals and records of the House or Senate. The highest exercise of this power of calling for documents, perhaps, would be, in the course of justice, by the courts of the United States, and the House would not for moment permit its journals to be taken from its possession by one of its assistant clerks and carried into a court in obedience to subpoena duly issued by the court. The mischief of the House calling for documents might easily be a very great one. Suppose the President is engaged in a negotiation with a foreign government, one of a most delicate character, upon which peace or war may depend, and which it is vitally necessary to keep secret; must he, at the call of the House, or of any committee of the House, spread upon its records such state secrets to the detriment of the country! Somebody must judge upon this point. It clearly cannot be the House or its committee, because they cannot know the importance of having the doings of the executive department kept secret. [*4] The head of the executive department, therefore, must be the judge in such case and decide it upon his own responsibility to the people, and to the House, upon a case of impeachment brought against him for so doing, if his acts are causeless, malicious, willfully wrong, or to the detriment of the public interests. Your committee regret that it has been impossible for the House to afford them sufficient time in which this grave question might be more satisfactorily and exhaustively examined; but, viewing it with the best light in which we find it, we are constrained to the conclusion at which we have arrived. Therefore, your committee report to the House that, in their opinion, George F. Seward has shown sufficient cause why he should not be sworn as a witness in the investigation of charges looking to his impeachment by the Committee on Expenditures in the State Department, and why he should not produce the books, whether they are private books solely, or, for the reason above stated, are public books, in which criminatory matter may be contained; and therefore recommend the adoption of the following resolution: Resolved, That, under the facts and circumstances reported from the Committee on Expenditures in the State Department, George F. Seward was not in contempt of the authority of this House in refusing to be sworn as a witness or produce before said committee the books mentioned in the subpoena duces tecum. BENJ. F. BUTLER For the Committee"

    "content": "CASES ADJUDGED IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AT OCTOBER TERM, 1952 UNITED STATES v. REYNOLDS ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. No. 21. Argued October 21, 1952.--Decided March 9, 1953. A military aircraft on a flight to test secret electronic equipment crashed and certain civilian observers aboard were killed. Their widows sued the United States under the Tort Claims Act and moved under Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for production of the Air Force's accident investigation report and statements made by surviving crew members during the investigation. The Secretary of the Air Force filed a formal claim of privilege, stating that the matters were privileged against disclosure under Air Force regulations issued under R. S. § 161 and that the aircraft and its personnel were 'engaged in a highly secret mission.' The Judge Advocate General filed an affidavit stating that the material could not be furnished 'without seriously hampering national security'; but he offered to produce the surviving crew members for examination by plaintiffs and to permit them to testify as to all matters except those of a 'classified nature.' Held: In this case, there was a valid claim of privilege under Rule 34; and a judgment based under Rule 37 on refusal to produce the documents subjected the United States to liability to which Con- gress did not consent by the Tort Claims Act. Pp. 2-12. (a) As used in Rule 34, which compels production only of matters 'not privileged,' the term 'not privileged' refers to 'privileges' as that term is understood in the law of evidence. P. 6. (b) When the Secretary lodged his formal claim of privilege, he invoked a privilege against revealing military secrets which is well established in the law of evidence. Pp. 6-7. (c) When a claim of privilege against revealing military secrets is invoked, the courts must decide whether the occasion for invoking the privilege is appropriate, and yet do so without jeopardizing the security which the privilege was meant to protect. Pp. 7-8. (d) When the formal claim of privilege was filed by the Secretary, under circumstances indicating a reasonable possibility that military secrets were involved, there was a sufficient showing of privilege to cut off further demand for the documents on the showing of necessity for its compulsion that had been made. P. 10. (e) In this case, the showing of necessity was greatly minimized by plaintiffs' rejection of the Judge Advocate General's offer to make the surviving crew members available for examination. P. 11. (f) The doctrine in the criminal field that the Government can invoke its evidentiary privileges only at the price of letting the defendant go free has no application in a civil forum where the Government is not the moving party but is a defendant only on terms to which it has consented. P. 12. 192 F. 2d 987, reversed. In a suit under the Tort Claims Act, the District Court entered judgment against the Government. 10 F. R. D. 468. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 192 F. 2d 987. This Court granted certiorari. 343 U. S. 918. Reversed and remanded, p. 12. Samuel D. Slade argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Acting Solicitor General Stern and Assisthnt Attorney General Baldridge. Charles J. Biddle argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief was Francis Hopkinson. Mr. Chief Justice Vinson delivered the opinion of the Court. These suits under the Tort Claims Act arise from the death of three civilians in the crash of a B-29 aircraft at Waycross, Georgia, on October 6, 1948. Because an important question of the Government's privilege to resist discovery is involved, we granted certiorari. 343 U.S. 918. The aircraft had taken flight for the purpose of testing secret electronic equipment, with four civilian observers aboard. While aloft, fire broke out in one of the bomber's engines. Six of the nine crew members and three of the four civilian observers were killed in the crash. The widows of the three deceased civilian observers brought consolidated suits against the United States. In the pretrial stages the plaintiffs moved, under Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for production of the Air Force's official accident investigation report and the statements of the three surviving crew members, taken in connection with the official investigation. The Government moved to quash the motion, claiming that these matters were privileged against disclosure pursuant to Air Force regulations promulgated under R.S. § 161. The District Judge sustained plaintiffs' motion, holding that good cause for production had been shown. The claim of privilege under R. S. § 161 was rejected on the premise that the Tort Claims Act, in making the Government liable 'in the same manner' as a private individual, had waived any privilege based upon executive control over governmental documents. Shortly after this decision, the District Court received a letter from the Secretary of the Air Force, stating that 'it has been determined that it would not be in the public interest to furnish this report. . . .' The court allowed a rehearing on its earlier order, and at the rehearing the Secretary of the Air Force filed a formal 'Claim of Privilege.' This document repeated the prior claim based generally on R.S. § 161, and then stated that the Government further objected to production of the documents 'for the reason that the aircraft in question, together with the personnel on board, were engaged in a highly secret mission of the Air Force.' An affidavit of the Judge Advocate General,United States Air Force, was also filed with the court, which asserted that the demanded material could not be furnished 'without seriously hampering national security, flying safety and the development of highly technical and secret military equipment.' The same affidavit offered to produce the three surviving crew members, without cost, for examination by the plaintiffs. The witnesses would be allowed to refresh their memories from any statement made by them to the Air Force, and authorized to testify as to all matters except those of a 'classified nature.' The District Court ordered the Government to produce the documents in order that the court might determine whether they contained privileged matter. The Government declined, so the court entered an order, under Rule 37 (b) (2) (i), that the facts on the issue of negligence would be taken as established in plaintiffs' favor. After a hearing to determine damages, final judgment was entered for the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeals affirmed, both as to the showing of good cause for production of the documents, and as to the ultimate disposition of the case asa consequence of the Government's refusal to produce the documents. We have had broad propositions pressed upon us for decision. On behalf of the Government it has been urged that the executive department heads have power to withhold any documents in their custody from judicial view if they deem it to be in the public interest. Respondents have asserted that the executive's power to withhold documents was waived by the Tort Claims Act. Both positions have constitutional overtones which we find it unnecessary to pass upon, there being a narrower ground for decision. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U. S. 462 (1951); Rescue Army v. Municipal Court of Los Angeles, 331 U. S.549, 574-585 (1947). The Tort Claims Act expressly makes the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to suits against the United States. The judgment in this case imposed liability upon the Government by operation of Rule 37, for refusal to produce documents under Rule 34. Since Rule 34 compels production only of matters 'not privileged,' the essential question is whether there was a valid claim of privilege under the Rule. We hold that there was, and that, therefore, the judgment below subjected the United States to liability on terms to which Congress did not consent by the Tort Claims Act. We think it should be clear that the term 'not privileged,' as used in Rule 34, refers to 'privileges' as that term is understood in the law of evidence. When the Secretary of the Air Force lodged his formal 'Claim of Privilege,' he attempted therein to invoke the privilege against revealing military secrets, a privilege which is well established in the law of evidence. The existence of the privilege is conceded by the court below, and, indeed, by the most outspoken critics of governmental claims to privileges. Judicial experience with the privilege which protects military and state secrets has been limited in this country. English experience hasbeen more extensive, but still relatively slight compared with other evidentiary privileges. Nevertheless, the principles which control the application of the privilege emerge quite clearly fromthe available precedents. The privilege belongs to the Government and must be asserted by it; it can neither be claimed nor waived by a private party. It is not to be lightly invoked. There must be a formal claim of privilege, lodged by the head of the department which has control over the matter, after actual personal consideration by that officer. The court itself must determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege, and yet do so without forcing a disclosure of the very thing the privilege is designed to protect. The latter requirement is the only one which presents real difficulty. As to it, we find it helpful to draw upon judicial experience in dealing with an analogous privilege, the privilege against self-incrimination. The privilege against self-incrimination presented the courts with a similar sort of problem. Too much judicial inquiry into the claim of privilege would force disclosure of the thing the privilege was meant to protect, while a complete abandonment of judicial control would lead to intolerable abuses. Indeed, in the earlier stages of judicial experience with the problem, both extremes were advocated, some saying that the bare assertion by the witness must be taken as conclusive, and others saying that the witness should be required to reveal the matter behind his claim of privilege to the judge for verification. Neither extreme prevailed, and a sound formula of compromise was developed. This formula received authoritative expression in this country as early as the Burr trial. There are differences in phraseology, but in substance it is agreed that the court must be satisfied from all the evidence and circumstances, and 'from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.' Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S. 479, 486-487 (1951). If the court is so satisfied, the claim of the privilege will be accepted without requiring further disclosure. Regardless of how it is articulated, some like formulat of compromise must be applied here. Judicial control over the evidence in a case cannot be abdicated to the caprice of executie officers. Yet we will not go so far as to say that the court may automatically require a complete disclosure to the judge before the claim of privilege will be accepted in any case. It may be possible to satisfy the court, from all the circumstances of the case, that there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged. When this is the case, the occasion for the privilege is appropriate, and the court should not jeopardize the security which the privilege is meant to protect by insisting upon an examination of the evidence, even by the judge alone, in chambers. In the instant case we cannot escape judicial notice that this is a time of vigorous preparation for national defense. Experience in the past war has made it common knowledge that air power is one of the most potent weapons in our scheme of defense, and that newly developing electronic devices have greatly enhanced the effective use of air power. It is equally apparent that these electronic devices must be kept secret if their full military advantage is, to be exploited in the national interests. On the record before the trial court it appeared that this accident occurred to a military plane which had gone aloft to test secret electronic equipment. Certainly there was a reasonable danger that the accident investigation report would contain references to the secret electronic equipment which was the primary concern of the mission. Of course, even with this information before him, the trial judge was in no position to decide that the report was privileged until there had been a formal claim of privilege. Thus it was entirely proper to rule initially that petitioner had shown probable cause for discovery of the documents. Thereafter, when the formal claim of privilege was filed by the Secretary of the Air Force, under circumstances indicating a reasonable possibility that military secrets were involved, there was certainly a sufficient showing of privilege to cut off further demand for the documents on the showing of necessity for its compulsion that had then been made. In each case, the showing of necessity which is made will determine how far the court should probe in satisfying itself that the occasion for invoking the privilege is appropriate. Where there is a strong showing of necessity, the claim of privilege should not be lightly accepted, but even the most compelling necessity cannot overcome the claim of privilege if the court is ultimately satisfied that military secrets are at stake. A fortiori, where necessity is dubious, a formal claim of privilege, made under the circumstances of this case, will have to prevail. Here, necessity was greatly minimized by an available alternative, which might have given respondents the evidence to make out their case without forcing a showdown on the claim of privilege. By their failure to pursue that alternative, respondents have posed the privilege question for decision with the formal claim of privilege set against a dubious showing of necessity. There is nothing to suggest that the electronic equipment, in this case, had any causal connection with the accident. Therefore, it should be possible for respondents to adduce the essential facts as to causation without resort to material touching upon military secrets. Respondents were given a reasonable opportunity to do just that, when petitioner formally offered to make the surviving crew members available for examination. We think that offer should have been accepted. Respondents have cited us to those cases in the criminal field, where it has been held that the Government can invoke its evidentiary privileges only at the price of letting the defendant go free. The rationale of the criminal cases is that, since the Government which prosecutes an accused also has the duty to see that justice is done, it is unconscionable to allow it to undertake prosecution and then invoke its governmental privileges to deprive the accused of anything which might be material to his defense. Such rationale has no application in a civil forum where the Government is not the moving party, but is a defendant only on terms to which it has consented. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion. Reversed and remanded. Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, and Mr. Justice Jackson dissent, substantially for the reasons set forth in the opinion of Judge Maris below. 192 F.2d 987. 28 U. S. C. §§ 1346, 2674. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 34. 'Rule 34. Discovery and Production of Documents and Things for Inspection, Copying, or Photographing. Upon motion of any party showing good cause therefor and upon notice to all other parties, and subject to the provisions of Rule 30 (b), the court in which an action is pending may (1) order any party to produce and permit the inspection and copying or photographing, by or on behalf of the moving party, of any designated documents, papers, books, accounts, letters, photographs, objects, or tangible things, not privileged, which constitute or contain evidence relating to any of the matters within the scope of the examination permitted by Rule 26 (b) and which are in his possession, custody, or control; or (2) order any party to permit entry upon designated land or other property in his possession or control for the purpose of inspecting, measuring, surveying, or photographing the property or any designated object or .operation thereon within the scope of the examination permitted by Rule 26 (b). The order shall specify the time, place, and manner of making the inspection and taking the copies and photographs and may prescribe such terms and conditions as are just.' 5 U.S.C. § 22: 'The head of each department is authorized to prescribe regulations, not inconsistent with law, for the government of his department, the conduct of its officers and clerks, the distribution and per- formance of its business, and the custody, use, and preservation of the records, papers, and property appertaining to it.' Air Force Regulation No. 62-7(5)(b) provides: 'Reports of boards of officers, special accident reports, or extracts therefrom will not be furnished or made available to persons outside the authorized chain of command without the specific approval of the Secretary of the Air Force.' 10 F.R.D. 468. 28 U.S.C. § 2674: 'The United States shall be liable, respecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.' 'Rule 37. Refusal to Make Discovery: Consequences. (b) Failure to Comply With Order. (2) Other Consequences If any party or an officer or managing agent of a party refuses to obey . . . an order made under Rule 34 to produce any document . . ., the court may make such orders in regard to the refusal as are just, and among others the following: (i) An order that the matters regarding which the questions were asked, or the character or description of the thing or land, or the contents of the paper, or the physical or mental condition of the party, or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order; . . . .' 192 F.2d 987. While claim of executive power to suppress documents is based more immediately upon R. S. § 161 (see supra, note 4), the roots go much deeper. It is said that R. S. § 161 is only a legislative recognition of an inherent executive power which is protected in the constitutional system of separation of power. 28 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) § 932; United States v.

    "content": "November 12, 1953 Dear Sir: I have your subpoena dated November 9, 1953, directing my appearance before your committee on Friday, November 13, in Washington. The subpoena does not state the matters upon which you seek my testimony, but I assume from the press stories that you seek to examine me with respect to matters which occurred during my tenure of the Presidency of the United States. In spite of my personal willingness to cooperate with your committee, I feel constrained by my duty to the people of the United States to decline to comply with the subpoena. In doing so, I am carrying out the provisions of the Constitution of the United States; and am following a long line of precedents, commencing with George Washington himself in 1796. Since his day, Presidents Jefferson, Monroe, Jackson, Tyler, Polk, Fillmore, Buchanan, Lincoln, Grant, Hayes, Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, Coolidge, Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt have declined to respond to subpoenas or demands for information of various kinds by Congress. The underlying reason for this clearly established and universally recognized constitutional doctrine has been succinctly set forth by Charles Warren, one of our leading constitutional authorities, as follows: 'In this long series of contests by the Executive to maintain his constitutional integrity, one sees a legitimate conclusion from our theory of government. * * * Under our Constitution, each branch of the Government is designed to be a coordinate representative of the will of the people. * * * Defense by the Executive of his constitutional powers becomes in very truth, therefore, defense of popular rights—defense of power which the people granted to him. It was in that sense that President Cleveland spoke of his duty to the people not to relinquish any of the powers of his great office. It was in that sense that President Buchanan stated the people have rights and prerogatives in the execution of his office by the President which every President is under a duty to see ‘shall never be violated in his person’ but ‘passed to his successors unimpaired by the adoption of a dangerous precedent.’ In maintaining his rights against a trespassing Congress, the President defends not himself, but popular government; he represents not himself but the people.' President Jackson repelled an attempt by the Congress to breakdown the separation of powers in these words: 'For myself I shall repel all such attempts as an invasion of the principles of justice as well as the Constitution, and I shall esteem it my sacred duty to the people of the United States to resist them as I would the establishment of a Spanish Inquisition.' I might comment to your reading the opinion of one of the committees of the House of Representatives in 1879, House Report 141, March 3, 1879, Forty-fifth Congress, Third Session, in which the House Judiciary Committee said the following: 'The Executive is as independent of either house of Congress is independent of him, and they cannot call for the records of his actions, or the action of his officers against his consent, any more than he can call for any of the journals or records of the House or Senate.' It must be obvious to you that if the doctrine of separation of powers and the independence of the Presidency is to have any validity at all, it must be equally applicable to a President after his term of office has expired when he is sought to be examined with respect to any acts occurring while he is President. The doctrine would be shattered, and the President, contrary to our fundamental theory of constitutional government, would become a mere arm of the Legislative Branch of the Government if he would feel during his term of office that his every act might be subject to official inquiry and possible distortion for political purposes. If your intention, however, is to inquire into any acts as a private individual either before or after my Presidency and unrelated to any acts as President, I shall be happy to appear. Very Truly Yours, Harry S. Truman"

    "content": "The honorable Secretary of Defense, Washington, D.C. Dear Mr. Secretary: It has long been recognized that to assist the Congress in achieving its legislative purposes every executive department or agency must, upon the request of a congressional committee, expeditiously furnish information relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee, with certain historical exceptions--some of which are pointed out in the attached memorandum from the Attorney General. This administration has been and will continue to be diligent in following this principle. However, it is essential to the successful working of our system that the persons entrusted with power in any one of the three great branches of Government shall not encroach upon the authority confided to the others. The ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the executive branch rests with the President. Within this constitutional framework each branch should cooperate fully with each other for the common good. However, throughout our history the President has withheld information whenever he found that what was sought was confidential or its disclosure would be incompatible with the public interest or jeopardize the safety of the Nation. Because it is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the executive branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters, and because it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications, or any documents or reproductions, concerning such advice be disclosed, you will instruct employees of your Department that in all of their appearances before the subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Government Operations regarding the inquiry now before it they are not to testify to any such conversations or communications or to produce any such documents or reproductions. This principle must be maintained regardless of who would be benefited by such disclosures. I direct this action so as to maintain the proper separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of the Government in accordance with my responsibilities and duties under the Constitution. This separation is vital to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power by any branch of the Government. By this action I am not in any way restricting the testimony of such witnesses as to what occurred regarding any matters where the communication was directly between any of the principals in the controversy within the executive branch on the one hand and a member of the subcommittee or its staff on the other. Sincerely, Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorandum For: The President. From: The Attorney General. One of the chief merits of the American system of written constitutional law is that all the powers entrusted to the Government are divided Into three great departments, the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. It is essential to the successful working of this system that the persons entrusted with power in any one of these branches shall not be permitted to encroach upon the powers confided to the others, but that each shall be limited to the exercise of the powers appropriate to its own department and no other. The doctrine of separation of powers was adopted to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power and to save the people from autocracy. This fundamental principle was fully recognized by our first President, George Washington, as early as 1796 when he said: '* * * it is essential to the due administration of the Government that the boundaries fixed by the Constitution between the different departments should be preserved * * *.' In his Farewell Address, President Washington again cautioned strongly against the danger of encroachment by one department into the domain of another as leading to despotism. This principle has received steadfast adherence throughout the many years of our history and growth. More than ever, it is our duty today to heed these words if our country is to retain its place as a leader among the free nations of the world. For over 150 years—almost from the time that the American form of government was created by the adoption of the Constitution—our Presidents have established, by precedent, that they and members of their Cabinet and other heads of executive departments have an undoubted privilege and discretion to keep confidential, in the public interest, papers and information which require secrecy. American history abounds in countless illustrations of the- refusal, on occasion, by the President and heads of departments to furnish papers to Congress, or its committees, for reasons of public policy. The messages of our past Presidents reveal that almost every one of them found it necessary to inform Congress of his constitutional duty to execute the Office of President, and, in furtherance of that duty, to withhold information and papers for the public good. Nor are the instances lacking where the aid of a court was sought in vain to obtain information or papers from a President and the heads of departments. Courts have uniformly held that the President and the heads of departments have an uncontrolled discretion to withhold the information and papers in the public interest; they will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion, and that Congress has not the powers, as 1 of the 3 great branches of the Government, to subject the executive branch to its will any more than the executive branch may impose its unrestrained will upon the Congress. PRESIDENT WASHINGTON'S ADMINISTRATION In March 1792, the House of Representatives passed the following resolution: 'Resolved, That a committee be appointed to inquire into the causes of the failure of the late expedition under Major General St. Clair; and that the said committee be empowered to call for such persons, papers, and records, as may be necessary to assist their inquiries' (3 Annals of Congress, p. 493). This was the first time that a committee of Congress was appointed to look into a matter which involved the executive branch of the Government. The expedition of General St. Clair was under the direction of the Secretary of War. The expenditures connected therewith came under the Secretary of the Treasury. The House based its right to investigate on its control of the expenditures of public moneys. It appears that the Secretaries of War and the Treasury appeared before the committee. However, when the committee was bold enough to ask the President for the papers pertaining to the General St. Clair campaign, President Washington called a meeting of his Cabinet (Binkley, President and Congress, pp. 40-41). Thomas Jefferson, as Secretary of State, reports what took place at that meeting. Besides Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, Henry Knox, Secretary of War, and Edmond Randolph, the Attorney General, were present. The committee had first written to Knox for the original letters, instructions, etc., to General St. Clair. President Washington stated that he had called his Cabinet members together, because it was the first example of a demand on the Executive for papers, and he wished that so far as It should become a precedent, it should be rightly con- ducted. The President readily admitted that he did not doubt the propriety of what the House was doing, but he could conceive that there might be papers of so secret a nature that they ought not to be given up. Washington and his Cabinet came to the unanimous conclusion: 'First, that the House was an inquest, and therefore might institute inquiries. Second, that it might call for papers generally. Third, that the Executive ought to communicate such papers as the public good would permit, and ought to refuse those, the disclosure of which would injure the public; consequently were to exercise a discretion. Fourth, that neither the committee nor House had a right to call on the head of a department, 'who and whose papers were under the President alone; but that the committee should instruct their chairman to move the House to address the President.' The precedent thus set by our first President and his Cabinet was followed in 1796, when President Washington was presented with a resolution of the House of Representatives which requested him to lay before the House a copy of the instructions to the Minister of the United States who negotiated the treaty with the King of Great Britain, together with the correspondence and documents relative to that treaty. Apparently it was necessary to implement the treaty with an appropriation which the House was called upon to vote. The House insisted on its right to the papers requested, as a condition to appropriating the required funds (President and Congress, Wilfred 10. Binkley (1947), p. 44). President Washington's classic reply was, in part, as follows: 'I trust that no part of my conduct has ever indicated a disposition to withhold any information which the Constitution has enjoined upon the President as a duty to give, or which could be required of him by either House of Congress as a right; and with truth I affirm that it has been, as it will continue to be while I have the honor to preside in the Government, my constant endeavor to harmonize with the other branches thereof so far as the trust delegated to me by the people of the United States and my sense of the obligation it imposes to ‘preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution’ will permit' (Richardson's Messages and Papers of the Presidents, vol. 1, p. 194). Washington then went on to discuss the secrecy required in negotiations with foreign governments, and cited that as a reason for vesting the power of making treaties in the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. He felt that to admit the House of Representatives into the treatymaking power, by reason of its constitutional duty to appropriate moneys to carry out a treaty, would be to establish a dangerous precedent. He closed his message to the House as follows: 'As, therefore, it is perfectly clear to my understanding that the assent of the House of Representatives is not necessary to the validity of a treaty; * * * and as it is essential to the due administration of the Government that the boundaries fixed by the Constitution between the different departments should be preserved, a just regard to the Constitution and to the duty of my office, under all the circumstances of this case, forbids a compliance with your request' (Richardson's 'Messages and Papers of the Presidents,' vol. 1, p. 196). PRESIDENT JEFFERSON'S ADMINISTRATION In January 1807, Representative Randolph introduced a resolution, as follows: 'Resolved, That the President of the United States be, and he hereby is, requested to lay before this House any information in possession of the Executive, except such as he may deem the public welfare to require not to be disclosed, touching any illegal combination of private individuals against the peace and safety of the Union, or any military expedition planned by such individuals against the territories of any Power in amity with the United States; together with the measures which the Executive has pursued and proposes to take for suppressing or defeating the same' (16 Annals of Congress (1806-07), p. 336). The resolution was overwhelmingly passed. The Burr conspiracy was then stirring the country. Jefferson had made it the object of a special message to Congress wherein he referred to a military expedition headed by Burr. Jefferson's reply to the resolution was a message to the Senate and House of Representatives. Jefferson brought the Congress up to date on the news which he had been receiving concerning the illegal combination of private individuals against the peace and safety of the Union. He pointed out that he had recently received a mass of data, most of which had been obtained without the sanction of an oath so as to constitute formal and legal evidence. 'It is chiefly in the form of letters, often containing such a mixture of rumors, conjectures, and suspicions as renders it difficult to sift out the real facts and unadvisable to hazard more than general outlines, strengthened by concurrent information or the particular credibility of the relator. In this state of the evidence, delivered sometimes, too, under the restriction of private confidence, neither safety nor justice will permit the exposing names, except that of the principal actor, whose guilt is placed beyond question' (Richardson's 'Messages and Papers of the Presidents,' vol. 1, p. 412, dated January 22, 1807). SIMILAR ACTIONS BY PRESIDENTS JACKSON, TYLER, BUCHANAN, AND GRANT On February 10, 1835, President Jackson sent a message to the Senate wherein be declined to comply with the Senate's resolution requesting him to communicate copies of charges which had been made to the President against the official conduct of Gideon Fitz, late Surveyor-General, which caused his removal from office. The resolution stated that the information requested was necessary both in the action which it proposed to take on the nomination of a successor to Fitz, and in connection with the investigation which was then in progress by the Senate respecting the frauds in the sales of public lands. The President declined to furnish the information. He stated that in his judgment the information related to subjects exclusively belonging to the executive department. The request therefore encroached on the constitutional powers of the executive. The President's message referred to many previous similar requests, which he deemed unconstitutional demands by the Senate: 'Their continued repetition imposes on me, as the representative and trustee of the American people, the painful but imperious duty of resisting to the utmost any further encroachment on the rights of the Executive' (ibid., p. 133). The President next took up the fact that the Senate resolution had been passed in executive session, from which he was bound to presume that if the information requested by the resolution were communicated, it would be applied in secret session to the investigation of frauds in the sales of public lands. The President said that, if he were to furnish the information, the citizen whose conduct the Senate sought to impeach would lose one of his basic rights; namely, that of a public investigation in the presence of his accusers and of the witnesses against him. In addition, compliance with the resolution would subject the motives of the President, in the case of Mr. Fitz, to the review of the Senate when not sitting as judges on an impeachment; and even if such a consequence did not follow in the present case, the President feared that compliance by the Executive might thereafter be quoted as a precedent for similar repeated applications. 'Such a result, if acquiesced in, would ultimately subject the independent constitutional action of the Executive in a matter of great national concernment to the domination and control of the Senate: * * * 'I therefore decline a compliance with so much of the resolution of the Senate as requests 'copies of the charges, if any,' in relation to Mr. Fitz, and in doing so must be distinctly understood as neither affirming or denying that any such charges were made; * * *' (ibid., p. 134). One of the best reasoned precedents of a President's refusal to permit the head of a department to disclose confidential information to the House of Representatives is President Tyler's refusal to communicate to the House of Representatives the reports relative to the affairs of the Cherokee Indians and to the frauds which were alleged to have been practiced upon them. A resolution of the House of Representatives had called upon the Secretary of War to communicate to the House the reports made to the Department of War by Lieutenant Colonel Hitchcock relative to the affairs of the Cherokee Indians together with all information communicated by him concerning the frauds he was charged to investigate; also all facts in the possession of the Executive relating to the subject. The Secretary of War consulted with the President and under the latter's direction informed the House that negotiations were then pending with the Indians for settlement of their claims; in the opinion of the President and the Department, therefore, publication of the report at that time would be inconsistent with the public interest. The Secretary of War further stated in his answer to the resolution that the report sought by the House, dealing with alleged frauds which Lieutenant Colonel Hitchcock was charged to investigate, contained information which was obtained by Colonel Hitchcock by ex parte inquiries of persons whose statements were without the sanction of an oath, and which the persons implicated had bad no opportunity to contradict or explain. The Secretary of War expressed the opinion that to promulgate those statements at that time would be grossly unjust to those persons, and would defeat the object of the inquiry. He also remarked that the Department had not been given at that time sufficient opportunity to pursue the investigation, to call the parties affected for explanations, or to determine on the measures proper to be taken. The answer of the Secretary of War was not satisfactory to the Committee on Indian Affairs of the House, which claimed the right to demand from the Executive and heads of departments such information as may be in their possession relating to subjects of the deliberations of the House. President Tyler in a message dated January 31, 1843, vigorously asserted that the House of Representatives could not exercise a right to call upon the Executive for information, even though it related to a subject of the deliberations of the House, if, by so doing, it attempted to interfere with the discretion of the Executive. The same course of action was taken by President James Buchanan in 1860 in resisting a resolution of the House to investigate whether the President or any other officer of the Government had, by money, patronage, or other improper means sought to influence the action of Congress for or against the passage of any law relating to the rights of any State or Territory. (See Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents, vol. 5, pp. 618-619.) In the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant the House requested the President to inform it whether any executive offices, acts, or duties, and if any, what, have been performed at a distance from the seat of government established by law. It appears that the purpose of this inquiry was to embarrass the President by reason of his having spent some of the hot months at Long Branch. President Grant replied that he failed to find in the Constitution the authority given to the House of Representatives, and that the inquiry had nothing to do with legislation (Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents, vol. VII, pp. 362-363). PRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S ADMINISTRATION In 1886, during President Cleveland's administration, there was an extended discussion in the Senate with reference to its relations to the Executive caused by the refusal of the Attorney General to transmit to the Senate certain documents concerning the administration of the office of the district attorney for the southern district of south Alabama, and suspension of George W. Durkin, the late incumbent. The majority of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary concluded that it was entitled to know all that officially exists or takes place in any of the departments of Government and that neither the President nor the head of a department could withhold official facts and information as distinguished from private and unofficial papers. In his reply President Cleveland disclaimed any intention to withhold official papers, but he denied that papers and documents inherently private or confidential, addressed to the President or a head of a department, having reference to an act entirely executive such as the suspension of an official, were changed in their nature and became official when placed for convenience in the custody of a public department (Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents, vol. 8, pp. 378-379, 881). Challenging the attitude that because the executive departments were created by Congress the latter had any supervisory power over them, President Cleveland declared (Eberling, Congressional Investigation, p. 258) : 'I do not suppose that the public offices of the United States are regulated or controlled in their relations to either House of Congress by the fact that they were created by laws enacted by themselves. It must be that these instrumentalities were created for the benefit of the people and to answer the general purposes of Government under the Constitution and the laws, and that they are unencumbered by any lien in favor of either branch of Congress growing out of their construction, and unembarrassed by any obligation to the Senate as the price of their creation.' PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT'S ADMINISTRATION In 1909, during the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt, the question of the right of the President to exercise complete direction and control over heads of executive departments was raised again. At that time the Senate passed a resolution directing the Attorney General to inform the Senate whether certain legal proceedings had been instituted against the United States Steel Corp., and if not, the reasons for its nonaction. Request was also made for any opinion of the Attorney General, if one was written. President Theodore Roosevelt replied refusing to honor this request upon the ground that 'Heads of the executive departments are subject to the Constitution, and to the laws passed by the Congress in pursuance of the Constitution, and to the directions of the President of the United States, but to no other direction whatever' (Congressional Record, vol. 43, pt. 1, 60th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 527-528). When the Senate was unable to get the documents from the Attorney General, it summoned Herbert K. Smith, the head of the Bureau of Corporations, and requested the papers and documents on penalty of imprisonment for contempt. Mr. Smith reported the request to the President, who directed him to turn over to the President all the papers in the case 'so that I could assist the Senate in the prosecution of its investigation.' President Roosevelt then informed Senator Clark of the Judiciary Committee what had been done, that he had the papers and the only way the Senate could get them was through his impeachment. President Roosevelt also explained that some of the facts were given to the Government under the seal of secrecy and cannot be divulged, 'and I will see to it that the word of this Government to the individual is kept sacred' (Corwin, The President-Office and Powers, pp. 281, 428; Abbott, The Letters of Archie Butt, Personal Aide to President Roosevelt, pp. 305-306). PRESIDENT COOLIDGE’S ADMINISTRATION In 1924, during the administration of President Coolidge, the latter objected to the action of a special investigating committee appointed by the Senate to investigate the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Request was made by the committee for a list of the companies in which the Secretary of the Treasury was alleged to be interested for the purpose of investigating their tax returns. Calling this exercise of power an unwarranted intrusion, President Coolidge said: 'Whatever may be necessary for the information of the Senate or any of its committees in order to better enable them to perform their legislative or other constitutional functions ought always to be furnished willingly and expeditiously by any department. But it is recognized both by law and custom that there is certain confidential information which it would be detrimental to the public service to reveal' (68th Cong., 1st sess., Record, April 11, 1924, p. 6087). PRESIDENT HOOVER'S ADMINISTRATION A similar question arose in 1930 during the administration of President Hoover. Secretary of State Stimson refused to disclose to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee certain confidential telegrams and letters leading up to the London Conference and the London Treaty. The committee asserted its right to have full and free access to all records touching the negotiations of the treaty, basing its right on the constitutional prerogative of the Senate in the treatymaking process. In his message to the Senate, President Hoover pointed out that there were a great many informal statements and reports which were given to the Government in confidence. The Executive was under a duty, in order to maintain amicable relations with other nations, not to publicize all the negotiations and statements which went into the making of the treaty. He further declared that the Executive must not be guilty of a breach of trust, nor violate the invariable practice of nations. 'In view of this, I believe that to further comply with the above resolution would be incompatible with the public interest' (S. Doc. No. 216, 71st Cong., special sess., p. 2). PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT'S ADMINISTRATION The position was followed during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. There were many instances in which the President and his executive heads refused to make available certain information to Congress, the disclosure of which was deemed to be confidential or contrary to the public interest. Merely a few need be cited. 1. Federal Bureau of Investigation records and reports were refused to congressional committees, in the public interest (40 Op. A. G. No. 8, April 30, 1941). 2. The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation refused to give testimony or to exhibit a copy of the President's directive requiring him, in the interests of national security, to refrain from testifying or from disclosing the contents of the Bureau's reports and activities. (Hearings, vol. 2, House, 78th Cong. Select Committee To Investigate the Federal Communications Commission (1944), p. 2337.) 3. Communications between the President and the heads of departments were held to be confidential and privileged and not subject to inquiry by a committee of one of the Houses of Congress. (Letter dated January 22, 1944, signed Francis Biddle, Attorney General, to Select Committee, etc.) 4. The Director of the Bureau of the Budget refused to testify and to produce the Bureau's files, pursuant to subpena [sic] which had been served upon him, because the President had instructed him not to make public the records of the Bureau due to their confidential nature. Public interest was again invoked to prevent disclosure. (Reliance placed on Attorney General's opinion in 40 Op. A. G. No. 8, April 30, 1941.) 5. The Secretaries of War and Navy were directed not to deliver documents which the committee had requested, on grounds of public interest. The Secretaries, in their own judgment, refused permission to Army and Navy officers to appear and testify because they felt that it would be contrary to the public interest. (Hearings, Select Committee To Investigate the Federal Communications Commission, vol. 1, pp. 46,48-68.) PRESIDENT TRUMAN'S ADMINISTRATION During the Truman administration also the President adhered to the traditional executive view that the President's discretion must govern the surrender of executive files. Some of the major incidents during the administration of President Truman in which information, records, and files were denied to congressional committees were as follows: Date	Type of document refused March 4, 1948	FBI letter-report on Dr. Condon, Director of National Bureau of Standards, refused by Secretary of Commerce March 15, 1948	President issued directive forbidding all executive departments and agencies to furnish information or reports concerning loyalty of their employees to any court or committee of Congress, unless President approves. March 1948 Dr. John R. Steelman, confidential adviser to the President, refused to appear before Committee on Education and Labor of the House, following the service of two subpenas [sic] upon him. President directed him not to appear. August 5, 1948 Attorney General wrote Senator Ferguson, chairman of Senate Investigations Subcommittee, that he would not furnish letters, memorandums, and other notices which the Justice Department had furnished to other Government agencies concerning W. W. Remington. February 22, 1950 Senate Resolution 231 directing Senate subcommittee to procure State Department loyalty files was met with President Truman's refusal, following vigorous opposition of J. Edgar Hoover. March 27, 1950	Attorney General and Director of FBI appeared before Senate subcommittee. Mr. Hoover's historic statement of reasons for refusing to furnish raw files approved by Attorney General. May 16, 1951 General Bradley refused to divulge conversations between President and his advisers to combined Senate. Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees. January 31, 1952 President Truman directed Secretary of State to refuse to Senate Internal Security Subcommittee the reports and views of Foreign Service officers. April 22, 1952 Acting Attorney General Perlman laid down procedure for complying with requests for inspection of Department of Justice files by Committee on Judiciary: Requests on open cases would not be honored. Status report will be furnished. As to closed cases, files would be made available. All FBI reports and confidential information would not be made available. As to personnel files, they are never disclosed. April 3, 1952 President Truman instructed Secretary of State to withhold from Senate Appropriations subcommittee files on loyalty and security investigations of employees—policy to apply to all executive agencies. The names of individuals determined to be security risks would not be divulged. The voting record of members of an agency loyalty board would not be divulged. Thus, you can see that the Presidents of the United States have withheld information of executive departments or agencies whenever it was found that the information sought was confidential or that its disclosure would be incompatible with the public interest or jeopardize the safety of the Nation. The courts too have held that the question whether the production of the papers was contrary to the public interest was a matter for the executive to determine. By keeping the lines which separate and divide the three great branches of our Government clearly defined, no one branch has been able to encroach upon the powers of the other. Upon this firm principle our country's strength, liberty, and democratic form of government will continue to endure."

    "content": "Memorandum for the Honorable John D. Ehrlichman Assistant to The President for Domestic Affairs Re: Power of Congressional Committee to Compel Appearance or Testimony of 'White House Staff'. This subject obviously raises the question of 'Executive Privilege', since generally speaking the power of a congressional committee to investigate is an extremely broad one--as broad as the potential power of Congress to legislate. Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109 (1959). And the power to investigate carries with it the power to compel the testimonyof a witness: 'We are of the opinion that the power of inquiry--with process to enforce it--is an essential and appropriate auxilliary to the legislative function.' McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135. Thus, if 'White House staff'  personnel are to be exempt from appearing or testifying before a congressional committee, it is because they have some special immunity or privilege not accorded others. It may be helpful to mention several closely related but not identical problems, any one of which could be the subject of a learned discourse which it would be neither possible nor profitable for you to read at length: (a) Cabinet officers in the past have refused to accept subpoenas, but nonetheless have appeared and testified voluntarily on the subject matters specified in the subpoena; the technical question of the manner in which testimony may be compelled, if it is compellable at all, would, I think, be of relatively little concern unless one were defending a contempt prosecution. If a subpoena is insisted upon, and the committee has its back up, a subpoena will undoubtedly be sent, so that the presence or absence of a subpoena is not likely to be the critical element in a decision as to whether or not a presidential adviser should testify. (b) Another slight variant of the problem is the subpoena requiring appearance at a place away from the Seat of Government. As you may recall, this question arose at the time of the trial of Aaron Burr for treason before John Marshall, sitting as a circuit judge in Richmond. Marshall issued a subpoena to Thomas Jefferson, who was then President, requiring Jefferson to produce certain documents; Jefferson responded with a letter saying in effect that if the courts were free to summon the President from place to place throughout the United States, he would be at their mercy in a manner incompatible with the coordinate statute of the Executive Branch of Government. That dispute between these two bitter enemies was not resolved--Jefferson did not in fact appear. In the misdemeanor prosecution of Aaron Burr, Chief Justice Marshall, while adhering to his position that the President is subject to subpoena, conceded: 'In no case of this kind would a court be required to proceed against the president as against an ordinary individual. The objections to such a course are so strong and so obvious that all must acknowledge them.' Roberson, Report of the Trials of Aaron Burr, Vol. 2, pp. 233, 236. Everyone associated with the Executive Branch from then until now, so far as I know, has taken the position that the President himself is absolutely immune from subpoena by anyone, at the Seat of Government or away from it. This, of course, does not answer the question as to whether his immediate advisers are likewise exempt. In 1806, a United States circuit court sitting in New York subpoenaed three Cabinet officers to appear and give testimony in a civil proceeding pending before that court. The three Cabinet officers declined to respond to the subpoena, advising the Court by letter that the press of their official duties prevented their absenting themselves from the Seat of Government, but offering to give testimony by deposition. United States v. Smith, 27 Fed. Cases 1194 (No. 16,342) (C.C.D. NY 1806). A similar ruling involving a Cabinet officer was made by Attorney General Moody in 1905. 25 Ops. A.G. 326. Thus, the Marshall-Jefferson precedent involved two very strong arguments in favor of privilege which may not be present in other situations. First, the President himself was sought to be subpoenaed; second, he was sought to be subpoenaed to a place away from the Seat of Government. When a lesser official in the Executive Branch is sought to be subpoenaed at the Seat of Government, the Jefferson precedent, in my opinion, cannot be regarded as controlling. (c) Another related question is the obligation of the Executive Branch to furnish documents in nits custody to a congressional investigating committee. This, too, involves a question of Executive privilege, and George Washington asserted such a privilege with respect to documents concerning the ill-fated St. Clair Expedition during [*4] his Presidency, and it has been unvaryingly claimed by his successors. But the claim of privilege for documents is not necessarily co-extensive with the claim for personal immunity from subpoenas which is the subject of this memorandum. A claim for documents in the custody of the Executive Branch necessarily involves Executive business, whereas it cannot always be said to a certainty in advance that a White House adviser will necessarily be interrogated on a matter pertaining to his official duties. There is here, I think, a certain analogy to judicial proceedings, which have always made a distinction between a claim of absolute immunity from even being sworn as a witness, and a right to claim privilege in answering certain questions in the course of one's testimony as a witness. The former criminal defendant (and, under a recent ruling of the Court of Appeals for the ninth Circuit, of course, to Earl Caldwell, a New York Times reporter); the second type of privilege is available to attorneys, doctors, those who claim that an answer may incriminate them, and the like. But all of this second class must at least be sworn as witnesses, and invoke privilege only with respect to particular questions or particular lines of testimony. On the other hand, the furnishing of a document to a congressional committee involves little, if any, inconvenience to the Executive Branch or to the President and his advisers. The requirement of personal attendance of a witness at a hearing, on the other hand, does involve some degree of inconvenience, depending on the length of time the witness is expected to be present, the place the hearing is to be held, and the closeness of the relationship between the witness and the President. To this extent, then, the requirement of personal attendance by a witness is more burdensome to the Executive than is the requirement that a document be furnished. The practice with respect to past White House staff members has been erratic, and the only examples I have been able to find are ones concerning intimate advisers of the President--people in the position such as you occupy, as opposed to the positions occupied by those who report to you. On two occasions during the Administration of President Truman, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Education and Labor issued subpoenas to John R. Steelman, who held the title 'Assistant to the President'. In both instances he returned the subpoena with a letter stating that 'in each instance the President directed me, in view of my duties as his Assistant, not to appear before your subcommittee.' In 1951, Donald Dawson, an Administrative Assistant to President Truman, was requested to testify before a senate Subcommittee investigating the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, one aspect of which concerned Dawson's alleged wrongdoing. While President Truman felt that this request constituted a violation of the principle of the separation of powers, he nevertheless 'reluctantly' permitted Mr. Dawson to testify in order to give him an opportunity to clear his name. In 1944, Jonathan Daniels, an Administrative Assistant to President Roosevelt, refused to respond to a subpoena requiring him to testify with respect to his reported attempts to compel the resignation of the Rural Electrification Administrator. He grounded his refusal on the confidential nature of his relationship to the President. The subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Agriculture then unanimously recommended that he be cited for contempt. Thereupon Daniels wrote the Subcommittee Chairman that he still believed that a legislative committee could not require either the President or his Administrative Assistant to testify as to their conversations; that he had since conferred with the President; that the latter did not think in the particular matter his testimony would adversely affect the public interest, and that Daniels was therefore now willing to answer the subcommittee's questions. Sherman Adams, during the Eisenhower Administration, declined to testify before a committee investigating the Dixon-Yates Power contract on the ground of his confidential relationship with the President, but at a later point in the Administration volunteered to testify with respect to his dealings with Bernard Goldfine. During the hearings on the nomination of the Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the United States, the Senate Judiciary Committee requested W. DeVier Pierson, Associate Special Counsel to the President, to appear and testify regarding the drafting of legislation authorizing Secret Service protection for Presidential candidates. It had been reported to the Committee that Justice Fortas had participated in the drafting of this legislation, at a time when he was sitting as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Pierson declined the invitation, writing Senator Eastland as follows: 'As Associate Special Counsel to the President since March, 1967, I have been one of the 'immediate staff assistants' provided to the President by law. (3 U.S.C. 105, 106) It has been firmly established, as a matter of principle and precedents, that members of the President's immediate staff shall not appear before a congressional committee to testify with respect to the performance of their duties on behalf of the President. This limitation, which has been recognized by the Congress as well as the Executive, is fundamental to our system of government. I must, therefore, respectfully decline the invitation to testify in the hearings.' These precedents are obviously quite inconclusive, particularly if one seeks to apply them to lower level White House staff members. In a strictly tactical sense, the Executive Branch has a headstart in any controversy with the Legislative Branch, since the Legislative Branch wants something the Executive Branch has, and therefore the initiative lies with the former. All the Executive has to do is maintain the status quo, and he prevails. Congress, of course, has the authority to itself attach and detain a witness whom it regards as contumacious, and the threat to do this apparently prevailed in the Daniels incident. But the question of legal remedies is not the only one involved, as you are well aware. When the President claims Executive privilege and refuses either to divulge a document or to permit a witness to testify, he immediately draws to himself some criticism for 'withholding' relevant evidence from the Congress or from the public. While a soundly determined claim of Executive privilege is not only in the best interests of the Executive Branch as an institution but of the President himself, as inadequately justified claim of Executive privilege, hastily made at the behest of its beneficiary, may be an actual disservice to the President. The Jonathan Daniels episode seems to be such an example. To the extent that any generalizations may be drawn from the foregoing, they are necessarily tentative and sketchy. I offer the following: (1) The President and his immediate advisers--that is, those who customarily meet with the President on a regular or frequent basis--should be deemed absolutely immune from testimonial compulsion by a congressional committee. They not only may not be examined with respect to their official duties, but they may not even be compelled to appear before a congressional committee. They are presumptively available to the President 24 hours a day, and the necessity of either accommodating a congressional committee or persuading a court to arrange a more convenient time, could impair that availability. (2) I do not think this principle can or ought to be extended to all 'members' of the White House staff, whatever that group may include. Whether one wants to classify on the basis of what appropriation their salaries are paid out of the building in which they work, or otherwise, lower level White House staff members ought to have some form of testimonial privilege with respect to congressional investigating committees. But I think it far more in accordance with related doctrines in the law to say that such a privilege is not one which enable them to wholly disregard a subpoena, or to entirely refuse to appear before a congressional committee; instead, it is a privilege to refuse to testify with respect to any matter arising in the course of their official position of advising or formulating advice for the President. As a practical matter, this distinction may not be of great importance because if the Committee specifies the subject of the testimony in its request, and the subject is one with respect to which privilege may be claimed, the request itself could be declined on that basis. But in terms of advancing a coherent set of defensible principles, I think the distinction is an important one. (3) With respect to Cabinet members, the role of the Legislative Branch is somewhat more substantial; all held offices and administer departments which are created by Act of Congress. The Justice Department, for example, administers and enforces hundreds of statutes which are enacted by Congress. Whether or not the Attorney General himself may be compelled to appear as a witness before a congressional committee to testify as to the manner in which the Department performs these tasks, I think there is no question but that the Department is obligated to furnish some knowledgeable witness in response to a [*9] congressional request for testimony on this subject. On the other hand, I think it equally clear that no Cabinet officer could be interrogated at all with respect to what took place at a Cabinet meeting, or as to any portion of conferences or meeting which were called for the purpose of advising or formulating advice for the President. (4) It is vital that a recommendation that the President assert privilege be a considered one, because the consequences of initially asserting the claim and then receding from it in the face of public criticism are obviously more hurtful than an initial decision not to assert the claim. William H. Rehnquist Assistant Attorney General Office of Legal Counsel The term 'White House staff' is not used in any precise or technical sense. In view of the conclusions reached, no useful purpose would be served in attempting to fashion a definition of the term. President Jackson repeatedly claimed immunity from the congressional subpoena power. Warren, Presidential Declarations of Independence, 10 Boston University Law Review 1, 8-12 (1930). During the Teapot Dome investigation President Coolidge considered Attorney General Daugherty's recommendation to invoke Executive privilege as to his activities in the Department of Justice so ill-advised that he asked for his resignation. 101 Cong. Rec. 11461. The President can, of course, waive the privilege and permit either class of advisers to testify. In view of this, the President should be advised of any instance in which a member of the White House staff is subpoenaed or requested to testify."

Mr. Frank Shakespeare: I am enclosing a copy of Mr. Ablad's letter of February 28 to Mr. Robert Dockery of the Committee staff concerning the status of the Country Program Memoranda prepared by the United States Information Agency. I understand from Mr. Ablard's letter that the Memoranda are regarded as 'internal planning or working documents' and as such, the Agency believes that “it would not be appropriate to provide these documents to the Committee.' As you know, the “Agency in Brief 1972' publication describes this material in the following way: 'These CPM's (Country Program Memoranda) are designed to integrate USIS planning and resource allocation with overall U.S. objectives in the country. The CPM's encompass total Agency resources devoted to the country, including media products and materials supplied from Washington.' (p. 19) I believe this information would be of interest to all Members of the Committee and of particular assistance to them in connection with the Agency's authorization hearings, beginning March 20. In view of this, I am requesting that the Agency recon- sider its decision and agree to make this information available to the Committee. I should appreciate hearing from you on this matter at your earliest convenience and, hopefully, no later than March 10. If the original decision is maintained, I should like to know what the Agency's legal authority is for withholding this type of information from the Congress. Sincerely yours, J. W.

    "conent": "The White House, Washington, D.C., March 15, 1972. Memorandum for: The Secretary of State, the Director, U.S. Information Agency As you know, by a memorandum of August 30, 1971 to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, I directed 'not to make available to the Congress any internal working documents which would disclose tentative planning data on future years of the military assistance program which are not approved Executive Branch positions.' In that memorandum, I fully explained why I considered that the disclosure of such internal working papers to the Congress would not be in the public interest. I have now been informed that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee have requested basic planning documents submitted by th [sic] country field teams to the United States Information Agency and the Agency for International Development, and other similar papers. These documents include all USIA Country Program Memoranda and the AID fiscal year 1973 Country Field Submission for Cambodia, which are prepared in the field for the benefit of the agencies and the Department of State and contain recommendations for the future. I hereby reiterate the position of this Administration so that there can be no misunderstanding on this point. My memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, dated March 24, 1969, set forth our basic policy which is to comply to the fullest extent possible with Congressional requests for information. In pursuance of this policy, the Executive Departments and Agencies have provided to the Congress an un- precedented volume of information. In addition, Administration witnesses have appeared almost continuously before appropriate Committees of the Congress to present pertinent facts and information to satisfy Congressional needs in its oversight function and to present the views of the Administration on proposed legislation. The precedents on separation of powers established by my predecessors from first to last clearly demonstrate, however, that the President has the responsibility not to make available any information and material which would impair the orderly function of the Executive Branch of Government, since to do so would not be in the public interest. As indicated in my memorandum of March 24, 1969, this Administration will invoke Executive Privilege to withhold information only in the most compelling circumstances and only after a rigorous inquiry into the actual need for its exercise. In accordance with the procedures established in my memorandum of March 24, 1969, I have conducted an inquiry with regard to the Congressional requests brought to my attention in this instance. The basic planning data and the various internal staff papers requested by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Operations and Government Information Sub- committee do not, insofar as they deal with future years, reflect any approved program of this Administration, but only proposals that are under consideration. Furthermore, the basic planning data requested reflect only tentative intermediate staff level thinking, which is but one step in the process of preparing recommendations to the Department Heads, and thereafter to me. I repeat my deep concern, shared by my predecessors, that unless privacy of preliminary exchange of views between personnel of the Executive Branch can be main- tained, the full frank and healthy expression of opinion which is essential for the successful administration of Government would be muted. Due to these new requests for documents of a similar nature to those covered by my August 30, 1971 directive, [sic] Due to these facts and considerations, it is my determination that these documents fall within the conceptual scope of my directive of August 30, 1971 and that their disclosure to the Congress would also, as in that instance, not be in the public interest. I, therefore, direct you not to make available to the Congress any internal working documents concerning the foreign assistance program or international information activities, which would disclose tentative planning data, such as is found in the Country Program Memoranda and the Country Field Submissions, and which are not approved positions. I have again noted that you and your respective Department and Agency have already provided much information and haVe offered to provide additional information including planning material and factors relating to our foreign assistance programs and international information activities. In implementing my general policy to provide the fullest possible information to the Congress, I will expect you and the other Heads of Departments and Agencies to continue to make available to the Congress all information relating to the foreign assistance program and international information activities not inconsistent with this directive.

    "content": "THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON The Western White House San Clemente July 6, 1973 Dear Mr. Chairman: I am advised that members of the Senate Select Committee have raised the desirability of my testifying before the Committee. I am further advised that the Committee has requested access to Presidential papers prepared or received by former members of my staff. In this letter I shall state the reasons why I shall not testify before the Committee or permit access to Presidential papers. I want to strongly emphasize that my decision, in both cases, is based on my Constitutional obligation to preserve intact the powers and prerogatives of the Presidency and not upon any desire to withhold information relevant to your inquiry. My staff is under instructions to cooperate fully with yours in furnishing information pertinent to your inquiry. On 22 May 1973, I directed that the right of executive privilege, 'as to any testimony concerning possible criminal conduct or discussions of possible criminal conduct, in the matters presently under investigation,' no longer be invoked for present or former members of the White House staff. In the case of my former Counsel, I waived in addition the attorney-client privilege. These acts of cooperation with the Committee have been genuine, extensive and, in the history of such matters, extraordinary. The pending requests, however, would move us from proper Presidential cooperation with a Senate Committee to jeopardizing the fundamental Constitutional role of the Presidency. This I must and shall resist. No President could function if the private papers of his office, prepared by his personal staff, were open to public scrutiny. Formulation of sound public policy requires that the President and his personal staff be able to communicate among themselves in complete candor, and that their tentative judgments, their exploration of alternatives, and their frank comments on issues and personalities at home and abroad remain confidential. I recognize that in your investigation as in others of previous years, arguments can be and have been made for the identification and perusal by the President or his Counsel of selected documents for possible release to the Committees or their staffs. But such a course, I have concluded, would inevitably result in the attrition, and the eventual destruction, of the indispensable principle of confidentiality of Presidential papers. The question of testimony by members of the White House staff presents a difficult but different problem. While notes and papers often involve a wide-ranging variety and intermingling of confidential matters, testimony can, at least, be limited to matters within the scope of the investigation. For this reason, and because of the special nature of this particular investigation, I have agreed to permit the unrestricted testimony of present and former White House staff members before your Committee. The question of my own testimony, however, is another matter. I have concluded that if I were to testify before the Committee irreparable damage would be done to the Constitutional principle of separation of powers. My position in this regard is supported by ample precedents with which you are familiar and which need not be recited here. It is appropriate, however, to refer to one particular occasion on which this issue was raised. In 1953 a Committee of the House of Representatives sought to subpoena former President Truman to inquire about matters of which he had personal knowledge while he had served as President. As you may recall, President Truman declined to comply with the subpoena on the ground that the separation of powers forbade his appearance. This position was not challenged by the Congress. It is difficult to improve upon President Truman's discussion of this matter. Therefore, I request that his letter, which is enclosed for the Committee's convenience, be made part of the Committee's record. The Constitutional doctrine of separation of powers is fundamental to our structure of government. In my view, as in the view of previous Presidents, its preservation is vital. In this respect, the duty of every President to protect and defend the Constitutional rights and powers of his Office is an obligation that runs directly to the people of this country. The White House staff will continue to cooperate fully with the Committee in furnishing information relevant to its investigation except in those instances where I determine that meeting the Committee's demands would violate my Constitutional responsibility to defend the office of the Presidency against encroachment by other Branches. At an appropriate time during your hearings, I intend to address publicly the subjects you are considering. In the meantime, in the context of Senate Resolution 60, I consider it my Constitutional responsibility to decline to appear personally under any circumstances before your Committee or to grant access to Presidential files. I respect the responsibilities placed upon you and your colleagues by Senate Resolution 60. I believe you and your Committee colleagues equally respect the responsibility placed upon me to protect the rights and powers of the Presidency under the Constitution. Sincerely, Richard Nixon Honorable Sam J. Ervin, Jr.  Chairman  Select Committee on Presiential Campaign Activities  United States Senate  Washington, D.C. 20510 Enclosure cc: Honorable Howard H.

    "content": "PRELIMINARY MEMORANDUM TO SELECT COMMITTEE RE CONGRESSIONAL POWER TO SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS IN WHITE HOUSE CUSTODY President Nixon, in his letter of July 6, 1973 (attached) has refused to permit The Select Committee access to papers prepare or received by his personal staff, which papers he has termed 'Presidential papers.' Though he has declined to use the term, he is, in fact, asserting the doctrine of executive privilege as to all 'the private papers of his office, prepared by his personal staff' in order, it is said, that his personal staff may 'communicate among themselves in complete candor.' There is substantial debate among legal scholars as to whether executive privilege has any legal existence. Professor Raoul Berger had contended quite forcefully that there is no such concept. See generally, Berger, Executive Privilege v. Congressional Inquiry, 12 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 1044 (1965). Other authorities, however, contend that some sort of executive privilege should be recognized. See Kramer & Marcuse, Executive Privilege -- A Study of the Period 1953-1960, 29 Geo. Washington L. Rev. 623, 827 (1961). No federal court has ever been directly presented with the proposition of law advocated by Mr. Nixon, and consequently there is no legal precedent in his favor. However, it is not necessary to settle the debate as to whether executive privilege actually exists for it appears that in no event would it be applicable in the instant case. First, it is reasonable to conclude that the privilege has been waived; presidential aides and former aides have been allowed to testify in full regarding the Watergate affair without any assertion of the privilege; presidential documents in the possession of the witnesses have been submitted to the Select Committee without any claim to privilege. Mr. Nixon has “opened the door” to evidence and it is now difficult for him to argue that presidential documents regarding Watergate may be withheld. In this regard, it is worth noting that the distinction between testimonial and documentary evidence which the letter of July 6, 1973, attempts to draw is unpersuasive. The letter (at p.2) contends the testimonial evidence (can, at least, be limited to matter within the scope of the investigation.” (However, the President recognizes that the oral testimony will be, in fact, “unrestricted.”) But the letter fails to recognize that documentary evidence can also be restricted. Any Select Committee subpoena can be carefully drawn so that it is, in the letter’s terms, 'limited to matters within the scope of the investigation.” If a particular document covers matters both within and outside of the investigation, the irrelevant parts can be excised. There is, in short, no reason to draw a distinction between documentary and testimonial evidence and waiver of rights as to the former should also result in waiver as to the latter. The second reason that executive privilege is inapplicable in the present circumstances is that the doctrine may not be used as a device to conceal information relating to the commission of a crime. Serious charges of criminal misconduct at the highest level of government may have been made before the Select Committee. Certain files presently in the custody of the White House may support or rebut the charges. Such highly relevant information may not be shielded from the public on grounds of executive privilege. President Nixon’s prior statements on the privilege appear to support this conclusion. In his Guidelines of May 3, 1973, he defined Presidential papers as 'all documents produced or received by the President or any member of the White House staff in connection with his official duties.' (emphasis added). But no document produced or received in furtherance of a crime may be justifiably considered one resulting from an exercise of an official duty. See also the Presidential Press Release of May 22, 1973, at 8: 'Executive Privilege will not be invoked as to any testimony concerning possible criminal conduct or discussion of possible criminal conduct in the matters presently under investigation, including the Watergate affair and the alleged cover-up.' The case law supports the use of a subpoena to the President to achieve relevant information regarding the commission of crimes. Chief Justice Marshall, in United States v. Burr, 25 Fed. Cas. at 187 (No. 14964) (C.C. Va. 1807), with respect to relevant evidentiary documents in the custody of the President, stated: 'That the President of the United States may be subpoenaed, and examined as a witness, and required to produce any paper in his possession, is not controverted.' Though the Burr case is an old one, it is still good law as evidenced by the Supreme Court’s favorable citation in Branzburg v. Hayez, 408 U.S. 665, 689 n. 26 (1972). The Court also quoted with approval Jeremy Benthan’s observation, 'Were the Prince of Wales, The Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Lord High Chancellor, to be passing by in the same coach, while a chimney-sweeper and a barrow-woman were in dispute about a halfpenny worth of apples, and the chimney-sweeper or the barrow-woman were to think it proper to call upon them for their evidence, could they refuse it? No, most certainly.' 408 U.S. at 689 n. 26. Samuel Dash Chief Counsel James Hamilton Assistant Chief Counsel Ronald D. Rotunda Assistant Counsel July 10, 1973 Perhaps because he has already waived executive privilege as to testimony of his staff, the President ostensibly bases his refusal to produce Presidential papers on the doctrine of separation of powers, but his arguments sound in executive privilege terms. See further, 93 Cong. Rec. 40-41 (1930) (Remarks of Senator, later Justice, Black); 3 Hinds’ Precedents of the House of Representatives at 185, quoting House Report No. 271 (1844): 'Thus it appears that there exists no rule which would exclude any evidence from the House or a Committee of the House, which are as competent to guard the interests of the State, and have as high motives for doing so as the Executive can have.' It is worth noting, that a like issue has been decided by at least one state court. Opinion of the Justices, 328 Mass. 655, 660-61, 102 N.E. 2d 79, 85 (1951): The attempt of the Senate to secure such information as might be contained in the report was not an interference with the executive department of the government in violation of art. 30 of the Declaration of Rights, relating to separation of powers . . . . . . It was a permissible exercise of an attribute pertaining to legislative power.' (emphasis added.) See Kramer & Marcuse, Executive Privilege--A Study of the Period 1953-1960, 29 Geo. Washington L. Rev. 827, 901 (1961), noting that at the time of the Army-McCarthy hearings it was felt that certain information would have been privileged 'had not the Administration opened the door by volunteering information about it.” The waiver principle is well-recognized in the law. See Tigar, Forward: Waiver of Constitutional Rights: Disquiet in the Citadel, 84 Harv. L. Rev. 1 (1970): 'Voluntary disclosure of any such fact (which may in any degree form a link in a chain of evidence against the witness) evinces, the argument runs, an intention not to rely upon the privilege, at least not in that ofrum, and not with respect to the entire subject matter to which the initial disclosure relates. The same general rule is followed with respect to all testimonial privileges, constitutionally -based or not, including the lawyer-client, clergy man-penitent, and doctor-patient privileges.' Id. at 9-10 (citing Preliminary Draft of Proposed Rules of Evidence for the U.S. District Courts) (emphasis added). Moreover, as noted, some Presidential documents regarding Watergate have been received without Presidential objection. The 'precedents' cited by Mr. Nixon are not sufficiently delineated to allow comment on each, but we know of no incident where a President, faced with compelling evidence that crimes have been committed, has invoked the privilege to withhold documents that might bear on these or other criminal violations. See generally Berger, Executive Privilege v. Congressional Inquiry, 12 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 1044 (1965)."

    "content": "Dear Mr. Chairman: I have considered your request that I permit the Committee to have access to tapes of my private conversations with a number of my closest aides. I have concluded that the principles stated in my letter to you of July 6th preclude me from complying with that request, and I shall not do so. Indeed the special nature of tape recordings of private conversations is such that these principles apply with even greater force to tapes of private Presidential conversations than to Presidential papers. If release of the tapes would settle the central questions at issue in the Watergate inquiries, then their disclosure might serve a substantial public interest that would have to be weighed very heavily against the negatives of disclosure. The fact is that the tapes would not finally settle the central issues before your Committee. Before their existence became publicly known, I personally listened to a number of them. The tapes are entirely consistent with what I know to be the truth and what I have stated to be the truth. However, as in any verbatim recording of informal conversations, they contain comments that persons with different perspectives and motivations would inevitably interpret in different ways. Furthermore, there are inseparably interspersed in them a great many very frank and very private comments, on a wide range of issues and individuals, wholly extraneous to the Committee's inquiry. Even more important, the tapes could be accurately understood or interpreted only by reference to an enormous number of other documents and tapes, so that to open them at all would begin an endless process of disclosure and explanation of private Presidential records totally unrelated to Watergate, and highly confidential in nature. They are the clearest possible example of why Presidential documents must be kept confidential. Accordingly, the tapes, which have been under my sole personal control, will remain so. None has been transcribed or made public and none will be. On May 22nd I described my knowledge of the Watergate matter and its aftermath in categorical and unambiguous terms that I know to be true. In my letter of July 6th, I informed you that at an appropriate time during the hearings I intend to address publicly the subjects you are considering. I still intend to do so and in a way that preserves the Constitutional principle of separation of powers, and thus serves the interests not just of the Congress or of the President, but of the people. Sincerely, Richard Nixon"

    "content": "Department of Justice Washington, D.C. MEMORANDUM Re: Amenability of the President, Vice President and other Civil Officers to Federal Criminal Prosecution while in Office. The question whether a civil officer of the federal government can be the subject of criminal proceedings while he is still in office has been debated ever since the earliest days of the Republic. This inquiry raises the following separate although to some extent interrelated issues. First, whether the constitutional provisions governing impeachment, viewed in general terms, prohibit the institution of federal criminal proceedings prior to the exhaustion of the impeachment process. Second, if the first question is answered in the negative, whether and to what extent the President as the head of the Executive branch of the Government is amenable to the jurisdiction of the federal courts as a potential criminal defendant. Third, if it be determined that the President is immune from criminal prosecution because of the special nature of his office, whether and to what extent such immunity is shared by the Vice President. I. Must the Impeachment Process be Completed Before Criminal Proceedings May be Institued Against a Person Who is Liable to Impeachment? 1. Views of early commentators. Article II, section 4 of the Constitution provides: 'The President, the Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of Treason, Bribery, or other high crimes and Misdemeanors.' Article I, section 3, clause 7 provides: 'Judgment in cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States; but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.' The suggestion has been made that Article I, section 3, clauses 7 prohibits the institution of criminal proceedings against a person subject to impeachment prior to the termination of impeachment proceedings. Support for this argument has been sought in Alexander Hamilton's description of the pertinent constitutional provisions in the Federalist Nos. 65, 69 and 77, which explain that after removal by way of impeachment the offender is still liable to criminal prosecution in the ordinary course of law. Article I, section 3, clause 7, however, does not say that a person subject to impeachment may be tried only after the completion of that process. Instead the constitutional provision uses the term 'nevertheless.' The purpose of this clause thus is to permit criminal prosecution in spite of the prior adjudication by the Senate, i.e., to forestall a double jeopardy argument. A speech made by Luther Martin--who had been a member of the Constitutional Convention--during the impeachment proceedings of Justice Chase shows that Article I, section 3, clause 7 was designed to overcome a claim of double jeopardy rather than to require that impeachment must precede any criminal proceedings. Annals of Congress, 8th Cong., 2d Sess., col. 432. Similarly Mr. Justice Story teaches in his Commentaries on the Constitution: 'If the court of impeachment is merely to pronounce a sentence of removal from office and the other disabilities, then it is indispensable that provision should be made that the common tribunals of justice should be at liberty to entertain jurisdiction of the offence for the purpose of inflicting the common punishment applicable to unofficial offenders. Otherwise, it might be matter of extreme doubt whether, consistently with the great maxim above mentioned, established for the security of the life and limbs and liberty of the citizen, a second trial for the same offence could be had, either after an acquittal or a conviction, in the court of impeachments.' Vol. I, sec. 782. Rawle, another early commentator, states in his View on the Constitution of the United States of America (1829) at p. 215: 'But the ordinary tribunals, as we shall see, are not precluded, either before or after an impeachment, from taking cognizance of the public and official delinquency.' (Emphasis added.) 2. Interpretations of the impeachment clause by official bodies. The practical interpretation of the Constitution has been to the same effect. During the life of the Republic impeachment proceedings have been instituted only against 12 officers of the United States. Congressional Directory, 93 Cong., 1st Sess., p. 402. In the same time, presumably scores, if not hundreds, of officers of the United States have been subject to criminal proceedings for the offenses for which they could have been impeached. It may be suggested that if it is no answer to say that in most instances the officer presumably had resigned or been removed by the time he had been tried. If it really is the import of Article I, section 3, clause 7, that an officer of the United states may be subjected to criminal proceedings only after the conclusion of the impeachment procedure, the question of whether he is still in office at the time of the criminal trial can be viewed as immaterial. The constitutional text does not contain any express exception to that effect. Moreover, resignation or removal arguably does not terminate the impeachment power as a matter of law. It is true that as a practical matter, the House of Representatives and the Senate are reluctant to exercise their time-consuming impeachment functions after a case has become of less moment, because the offender is no longer in office, especially after he had renounced all monetary claims against the United States. However, because the sanctions for impeachment include disqualification to hold a federal office, as well as removal, an impeachment proceeding instituted subsequent to completion of the term, resignation, or dismissal, would not be a bootless act. And yet it would seem to be an unreasonable interpretation of the Constitution to move from the latter proposition to the conclusion--necessary under the argument that impeachment must precede indictment--that an offending federal officer acquires a lifetime immunity against indictment unless the Congress takes time to impeach him. There have been several instances of legislative actions envisaging the criminal prosecution of persons while still in office, and of the actual institution of criminal proceedings against federal officers while in office. i. Section 21 of the Act of April 30, 1790, 1 Stat. 117, provided that a judge convicted of having accepted a bribe 'shall forever be disqualified to hold any office of honour, trust or profit under the United States.' The disqualification provision of this section thus indicates that Congress anticipated criminal trials for bribery--an impeachable offense--prior to a judgment of the Senate providing for the removal and disqualification of the offender. It should be remember that this statute was enacted by the First Congress many members of which had been members of the Constitutional Convention. Obviously they, and President Washington who approved the legislation, did not feel that it violated the Constitution. The disqualification clause is now a part of the general bribery statute and applies to every officer of the United States. 18 U.S.C. § 201(e). ii. In 1796, Attorney General Lee advised the House of Representatives that if a judge is convicted of a serious crime his “removal from office may and ought to be a part of the punishment.” He continued that, since the judicial tenure is during good behavior, a judge could not be removed unless lawfully convicted of some official misconduct by way of 'information, or by an indictment before an ordinary court, or by impeachment before the Senate of the United States.' The Attorney General concluded that while impeachment “seems, in general cases, to be best suited to the trial fo so high and important an officer” it was not the only method, and in the particular circumstances he recommended trial of the judge by information or indictment. 3 HInds, Precedents of [*6] the House of Representatives 982-983, American State Papers (Misc.) Vol. I, p. 151. The House Committee, to which the matter had been referred, concurred in that recommendation. Hinds, ibid., Annals of Congress, 4th Cong., 2d Sess., col. 2320. Here again it was felt at that early stage of our constitutional life that, at least in regard to judges, impeachment did not have to precede the institution of criminal proceedings. Hence, Congress could provide for removal of a judge for bad behavior, evidenced, by a criminal conviction, although it has not done so, except in the instance of a bribery conviction. iii. Circuit Judge Davis retired in 1939 under the provisions of what is now 28 U.S.C. 371(b). Borkin, The Corrupt Judge, 116. In 1941 he was indicted for obstructing justice and tried twice. In both cases the jury was unable to agree and the indictment was ultimately dismissed. Id., p. 119. Only then did the Attorney General request Congress to impeach Judge Davis. The latter thereupon resigned from office waiving all retirement and pension rights. Id., at p. 120. This in effect mooted the need for impeachment, but arguably not the power of impeachment. See supra. iv. Judge Albert W. Johnson was investigated by a grand jury and testified before it prior to his resignation from office. See Finding of Fact #3 in Johnson v. United States, 122 C. Cl. 100, 101 (1952). v. The Department of Justice concluded in 1970 on the strength of precedents ## i and ii, supra, that criminal proceedings could be instituted against a sitting Justice of the Supreme Court. Shogan, A Question of Judgment, 230-233. vi. Circuit Judge Kerner was recently subjected to a grand jury investigation, indicted, and convicted while still in office. The question whether criminal proceedings can precede impeachment has been raised for the first time on appeal. In sum, the analysis of the text of the Constitution and its practical interpretation indicate that the Constitution does not require the termination of impeachment proceedings before an officer of the United States may be subjected to criminal proceedings. The caveat is that all of the above instances concerned judges, wo possess tenure under Article III only during “good behavior,” a provision not relevant to other officers. However, although this clause may be the basis for a congressional power to remove judges by processes other than impeachment, it is not directly responsive to the question whether impeachment must precede criminal indictment, nor was the clause the basis for the actions in the historic instances noted above. B. Troublesome Implications of a Proposition that Impeachment Must Precede Indictment. The opposite conclusion, viz., that a person who is subject to impeachment is not subject to criminal prosecution prior to the termination of the impeachment proceedings would create serious practical difficulties in the administration of the criminal law. As shall be documented, infra, every criminal investigation and prosecution of persons employed by the United States would give rise to complex preliminary questions. These include, first, whether the suspect is or was an officer of the United States within the meaning of Article II, section 4 of the Constitution, and second, whether the offense is one for which he could be impeached. Third, there would arise troublesome corollary issues and questions in the field of conspiracies and with respect to the limitations of criminal proceedings. An interpretation of the Constitution which injects such complications into criminal proceedings is not likely to be a correct one. Indeed, impractical or self-defeating interpretations of constitutional texts must be avoided. The Framers were experienced and practical men. This face, coupled with the purposive spirit of constitutional interpretation set by Chief Justice Marshall, has been the foundation for the endurance of our constitutional system for 186 years. 1. Definition of 'civil officer.' If liability to impeachment is a preliminary bar to criminal prosecution the question necessarily arises as to who is a 'Civil Officer of the United States' within the meaning of Article II, section 4, of the Constitution. An officer of the United States has been defined as a person appointed by one of the methods provided for in Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution, i.e., by the President by and with the advice of Senate, or, on the basis of a statutory authorization, by the President alone, the Courts of Law, or a Head of a Department. United States v. Mouat, 124 U.S. 303, 307 (1886). But as Chief Justice Marshall, while sitting as a Circuit Justice, pointed out in United States v. Maurice, 2 Brock. 96, 103, 26 Fed. Cas. 1211, 1214 (No. 15747) (C.C. Va., 1823) not every public employment is an 'office.' The latter term 'embraces the ideas of tenure, duration, emolument, and duties.' United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 393 (1867); United States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 511-512 (1878); Auffmordt v. Hedden, 137 U.S. 310, 326-328 (1890). The notion of 'office' in the constitutional sense thus presupposes a certain degree of continuity, a specification of duties, and of compensation. The most important aspect of this definition appears to be the requirement of tenure and duration. An assignment which envisages the performance of a single specific task, or of occasional and intermittent duties, the ad hoc position, is normally not considered to be an office. United States v. Germaine, supra; Auffmordt v. Hedden, supra; United States v. Maurice, supra; 37 Op. A.G. 204; The Constitution of the United States of America, Analysis and Interpretations, S. Doc. 39, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 497, 500. [*9] The decisions of the Supreme Court defining the term 'officer' in the constitutional sense did no involve a further important element, presumably because it was not relevant to the issues raised in them, viz., that an officer in the constitutional sense must also be invested with some portion of the sovereign functions of the government. Mecham, A Treatise on the Law of Public Office and Public Officers, secs. 1, 2, and 4, and the authorities therein cited, H. Rept. 2205, 55th Cong., 3d Sess., pp. 48-54; Cain v. United States, 73 F. Supp. 1019, 1021 (N.D., Ill. 1947); 22 Op. A.G. 187; 26 id. 24, 249 (1907). In the words of H. Rept. 2205, at p. 52, a person employed in the Executive branch is an officer only if he enforces the law in a manner so as to affect the rights of the people. A person employed by the United States who merely performs the duties of an expert, or advises or negotiates without being able to put into effect the result of his advice or suggestions therefore is not an officer in the constitutional sense. The requirement that an officer must be vested with some element of the sovereign power of the United states, necessarily exempts the vast majority of federal employees from the scope of the impeachment jurisdiction. There are only relatively few persons in the federal establishment woh actually have the power to make decisions which concern the public, but case-by-case determination could be difficult. The questions whether the position of a person employed by the Federal Government satisfies the requirements of tenure, duration, emolument, and duties, and whether any elements of the sovereignty of the United States are vested in it, frequently give rise to complex questions of law and fact. Hence, if an officer of the United States cannot be proceeded against criminally prior to the termination of impeachment proceedings, those difficult issues would be injected into the criminal prosecution of any sitting or former federal employee in order to determine whether or not he is an officer immune from criminal prosecution until trial by the Senate. We seriously question that this is the true import of the Constitution. 2. Offenses subject to impeachment. If it were assumed arguendo, despite our own conclusion to the contrary, that an officer of the United states is not subject to criminal proceedings prior to the conclusion of impeachment proceedings, the scope of that immunity necessarily would be limited to offenses subject to impeachment. Such an asserted rule automatically would create another difficult-to-administer jurisdictional defense, viz., whether the offense in question is non-impeachable and therefore, subject immediately to criminal proceedings. According to Article II, section 4 of the Constitution, officers of the United States can be impeached for 'Treason, Bribery and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.' There is no need to defined treason and bribery. But '[a]s there is no enumeration of offenses comprised under the last two categories, no little difficulty has been experienced in defining offenses in such a way that they fall within the meaning of the constitutional provisions.' The Constitution of the United States, Analysis and Interpretation, S. Doc. No. 39, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 556. Early commentators indicated that 'high Crimes and Misdemeanors' is a term of art intended to reach wrongs of a political or of a judicial character, neither limited to, nor encompassing all, indictable offenses. See, e.g., Story, Commentaries, op. cit., Vol. I, §§ 749, 764. Some writers stressed the political nature of offenses over which a tribunal for the trial of impeachments would have jurisdiction. In The Federalist, No. 65, Alexander Hamilton explained: 'A well-constituted court for the trial of impeachments is an object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a government wholly elective. The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, [*11] from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they related chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.' The following year during the Great Debate on the Removal Power of the President, James Madison submitted that, if the President improperly removed-- 'from office a man whose merits require that he should be continued in it * * * he [the President] will be impeachable by this House before the Senate for such an act of maladministration; for I contend that the wanton removal of a meritorious officer would subject him to impeachment and removal from his own high trust.' Annals of Congress, 1st Cong., col. 498. In 1790 and 1791 James WIlson, a signer to the Declaration of Independence and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, in his law lectures, defined the term “high misdemeanors” as malversation in office and he asserted: 'In the United States and in Pennsylvania, impeachments are confined to political characters, to political crimes and misdemeanors, and to political punishments.' The Works of James Wilson, Vol. 2, pp. 165, 166. Story’s detailed discussion of the rules governing impeachment, op. cit. (Vol. I, secs. 742-813), also stresses the political nature of impeachable offenses, and assigns this as the reason why they are to be tried before a tribunal more familiar with political practices than the courts of law. See, e.g., secs. 749, 764-765, 800. He also points out that offenses subject to impeachment necessarily cannot be limited to statutory crimes. He explained that if-- 'the silence of the statute-book [is] to be deemed conclusive in favor of the party until Congress have made a legislative declaration and enumeration of the offences which shall be deemed high crimes and misdemeanors * * * the power of impeachment, except as to the two expressed cases, is a complete nullity, and the party is wholly dispunishable, however, enormous may be his corruption or criminality. [*13] It will not be sufficient to say that, in the cases where any offence is punished by any statute of the United States, it may and ought to be deemed an impeachable offence. It is not every offence that by the Constitution is so impeachable. It must not only be an offence, but a high crime and misdemeanor.' Section 796. (Underscoring supplied). Yet to cite these commentators and say that impeachments are thought by some to be confined to wrongs of a political character more aptly characterizes the process than defines the offense. In short, it begs the question for a 'private' offense, of the sort that a non-officer may also commit, may have gross political ramifications if the perpetrator is a public officer. Is an offense that brings an office into disrepute and renders it dysfunctional a 'political' offense? Disregarding a functional analysis of the impeachment clause suggested by the above question, William Rawle, another early commentator, took a narrow view of the term 'impeachable offenses.' He would restrict it to the offenses committed while performing the duties of the office: 'The legitimate causes of impeachment have been already briefly noticed. They can only have reference to public character and official duty. The words of the text are treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. The treason contemplated must be against the United States. In general those offences which may be committed equally by a private person as a public officer, are not the subjects of impeachment. Murder, burglary, robbery, and indeed all offenses not immediately connected with office, except the two previously mentioned, are left to the ordinary course of judicial proceeding, and neither house can regularly inquire into them, except for the purpose of expelling the member.' View on the Constitution of the United States of America (1829) at 215. Certainly, a case can be made that if impeachment is a process by which the faith in and integrity and effectiveness of the office of an offending incumbent can be restored, offenses which tend to bring the office into disrepute or render it dysfunctional should be impeachable whether or not committed in an official capacity. The constitutional remedy must be commensurate with the constitutional need. Extortion or forgery committed in private transactions seemingly has just as enormous an impact on the office as does bribery. As the Supreme Court of Louisiana recently said in a case involving a state impeachment, because there is 'a deep and vital interest' in the office of Judge . . . the official conduct of judges, as well as their private conduct, is closely observed. When a judge, either in his official capacity or as a private citizen, is guilty of such conduct as to cause others to question his character and morals, the people not only lose respect for him as a man but lose respect for the court over which he presides as well.' In re Haggerty, 241 So. 2d 569 (La. 1970). See also A. Simpson, Federal Impeachments 50-53. In confronting this issue, Justice Story in his Commentaries chose the safest course and presented the arguments without resolving the issue whether impeachment should be confined to official acts: In the argument upon Blount’s impeachment, it was pressed with great earnestness that there is not a syllable in the Constitution which confines impeachments to official acts, and it is against the plainest dictates of common-sense [*15] that such restraint that should be imposed upon it. Suppose a judge should countenance or aid insurgents in a meditated conspiracy or insurrection against the government. This is not a judicial act, and yet it ought certainly to be impeachable. He may be called upon to try the very persons whom he has aided. Suppose a judge or other officer to receive a bribe not connected with his judicial office, could he be entitled to any public confidence? Would not these reasons for his removal be just as strong as if it were a case of an official bribe? The argument on the other side was, that the power of impeachment was strictly confined to civil officers of the United States, and this necessarily implied that it must be limited to malconduct in office. §805. It is not intended to express any opinion in these commentaries as to which is the true exposition of the Constitution on the points above stated. They are brought before the learned reader as matters still sub judice, the final decision of which may be reasonably left to the high tribunal constituting the court of impeachment when the occasion shall arise. Commentaries, op. cit. §§ 804, 805 (1833). One hundred and forty years later, the question concerning what criminal statutory offenses can be made the subject of impeachment proceedings remains open. For the offenses not falling within the impeachment jurisdiction, the offender/officer could be prosecuted even if the Constitution precluded the criminal prosecution of impeachable offenses prior to the conclusion of impeachment. However, if impeachment were indeed a condition precedent to criminal prosecution, a person accused of a common offense committed while in the employment of the United States could plead that the offensen was of a political nature and that he could not be prosecuted prior to the conclusion of impeachment proceedings. This would inject into the trial of a criminal case the delicate issue of what is a political or impeachable offense, and what constitutes a common non-impeachable crime. Further, this delicate issue seemingly would be before the wrong forum (see Story quotation above). The actual power to impeach vel non in every instance rests with the house of Representatives and not with the courts. And this congressional power -- laying aside the possible outcome in some future instance of alleged gross abuse -- subsumes within it the threshold issue of determining whether an offense is impeachable. In a criminal proceeding a judicial conclusion in favor of the impeachable nature of the offense would of course, not require the House of Representatives to impeach or the Senate to convict. Indeed, a number of considerations might induce nonaction by the Congress even if an “offense” were held by a court to be impeachable (and therefore a jurisdictional bar to indictment), e.g., (1) higher legislative priorities for other business -- legislation, treaty approvals, confirmation of appointments, investigations, (2) political pressures not to act, (3) inappropriateness of a political trial for the given offense, (4) an estimate of ultimate failure to garner the necessary simple majority in the House and two-thirds vote in the Senate, thereby precluding the attempt, (5) a desire not to exacerbate political relations because of the adverse effect on governmental concerns. For the above reasons, a rule that impeachment must precede indictment could operate to impede, if not bar, effective prosecution of offending civil officers. The sensible course, as a general proposition, is to leave to the judiciary the trial of indictable criminal offenses, and to Congress the scope of the overlapping impeachment jurisdiction. The gross impracticalities of a rigid rule that impeachment precede indictment demonstrate that it would be an unreasonable, and improper construction of the Constitution. 3. Problems presented by corollary issues. There are also reasons of a corollary nature which counsel against the conclusion that impeachment proceedings must be completed before a civil officer may be subjected to criminal proceedings. (a) During a grand jury investigation, it may appear for instance, that one of several co-conspirators is an officer of the United States [*17] as was the case in Johnson v. United States, supra. It would seriously interfere with the investigation if it had to be suspended in respect to that officer, or indeed as to the other co-conspirators, until the termination of impeachment proceedings. The alternative is equally unappealing. If evidence were nonetheless presented in respect to the other co-conspirators, serious charges would inevitably be levied against the civil officer who would not have the opportunity in a judicial tribunal to clear himself. Further, if the civil officer actually is involved in the conspiracy, his nonparticipation at trial could impede prosecution of the co-conspirators. (b) A similar consideration is presented by the statute of limitations. If an officer cannot be prosecuted prior to impeachment, the criminal statute of limitations could easily run in his favor. If his immunity blocked effective prosecution of co-conspirators, the statute of limitations might run their favor too. The Criminal Code does not contain and, to our knowledge, never has contained a section providing for the suspension of the statute of limitations in the case of an officeholder until the termination of impeachment proceedings. The absence of such provision suggests Congress has considered such a rule to be unnecessary. Such practical interpretation of the Constitution is entitled to great consideration. Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch 299, 309 (1803); Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 691 (1892); United States v. Midwest Oil Co., 236 U.S. 459, 472-473 (1915); United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 328-329 (1936). In sum, an interpretation of the Constitution which requires the completion of impeachment proceedings before a criminal prosecution can be instituted would enable persons who are or were employed by the Government to raise a number of extremely technical and complex defenses. It also would pressure Congress to conduct a large number of impeachment proceedings which would weigh heavily on its limited time. Such an interpretation of the Constitution is prima facie erroneous. II. Is the President Amenable to Criminal Proceedings While in Office? This part of the memorandum deals with the question whether and to what extent the President is immune from criminal prosecution while he is in office. It has been suggested in the preceding part that Article I, sec. 3, clause 7 of the Constitution does not require the exhaustion of the impeachment process before an officer of the United States can be subjected to criminal proceedings. The question therefore arises whether an immunity of the President from criminal proceedings can be justified on other grounds, in particular the consideration that the President's subjection to the jurisdiction of the courts would be inconsistent with his position as head of the Executive branch. It has been indicated above that there is no express provision in the Constitution which confers such immunity upon the President. Inasmuch as Article I, sec. 6, clause 1 expressly provides for a limited immunity of the members of the legislative branch, it could be argued that, e contrario, the President is not entitled to any immunity at all. This proposition, however, is not necessarily conclusive; it could be said with equal validity that Article I, sec. 6, clause 1 does not confer any immunity upon the members of Congress, but rather limits the complete immunity from judicial proceedings which they otherwise would enjoy as members of a branch co-equal with the judiciary. Further, as indicated by statements of Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist, No. 69, it could be said that the immunity of the President to criminal indictment and trial during his office may have been too well accepted to need constitutional mention (by analogy to the English Crown), and that the innovative provision was the specified process of impeachment extending even to the President. Hamilton's comments were made in the context of calming fears about Executive power and distinguishing the President from the English king. Regarding criminal liability, his strongest statement would have been to suggest that the President was subject to criminal liability before or after impeachment, yet on the occasion when he made the comparison he spoke only of criminal liability after impeachment. To be sure, there are strong statements by others to the point that the Convention did not wish to confer privileges on the [*20] President, but these were made in most general terms, and did not refer to the question now in issue. Further, despite these statements an early Congress did recognize one form of privilege in the Executive in at least one instance. The historical evidence on the precise point is not conclusive. A. Ambiguities in a Doctrinal Separation of Powers Argument. Any argument based on the position or independence of one of the three branches of the Government is subject to the qualification that the Constitution is not based on a theory of an airtight separation of powers, but rather on a system of checks and balances, or of blending the three powers. The Federalist, Nos. 47, 48 (James Madison). We must therefore proceed case-by-case and look to underlying purposes. This facet of any reasoning based on the doctrine of the separation of powers is necessarily stressed by those who oppose independence or immunity in a given instance. Examples include two dissenting opinions of Mr. Justice Holmes. In Springer v. Philippine Islands, 277 U.S. 189, 209-210 (1928), he gave graphic expression to the extent to which the blending element in the Constitution has blunted the principle of the separation of powers: 'The great ordinances of the Constitution do not establish and divide fields of black and white. Even the more specific of them are found to terminate in a penumbra shading gradually from one extreme to the other. * * * When we come to the fundamental distinctions it is still more obvious that they must be received with a certain latitude or our government could not go on.' And again in Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 177 (1926), he warns that any legal arguments drawn merely from the Executive power of the President, his duties to appoint officers of the United States and to commission them, and to take care that the laws be carefully executed seem to him 'spider's webs inadequate to control dominant facts.' Whether or not one agrees with Holmes or the full thrust of his rhetoric, most scholars would conceded that there are few areas under the Constitution to which a single branch of the Government can claim a monopoly. An argument based on the separation of powers must be illuminated therefore by constitutional practice. The difficulty of developing clear rules regarding the various possible facets of Presidential immunity is demonstrated by the limited and ambivalent case law developed in the fields of the amenability vel non of the President to civil litigation and to the judicial subpoena power. Much of this precedent has been discussed in our memorandum dated June 25, 1973, regarding Presidential Amenability to Judicial Subpoena. In the Burr treason trial, Chief Justice Marshall at first concluded that since the President is the first magistrate of the United States, and not a King who can do no wrong, he was subject to the judicial subpoena power. United States v. Burr, 25 Fed. Cas. 30, 34, No. 14,692 (C.C.D. Va., 1807). In the Burr misdemeanor trial, however, which took [*22] place only a few months later, the Chief Justice had to qualify significantly his claim of the subpoena power over the President by conceding that the courts are not required 'to proceed against the President as against an ordinary individual.' United States v. Burr, 25 Fed. Cas. 187, 190, No. 14,694 (C.C.D. Va., 1807). And by acquiescing in the privileges claimed by President Jefferson of not attending court in person and of withholding certain evidence for reasons of State, Chief Justice Marshall recognized that the power of the judiciary to subpoena the President is subject to limitations based on the needs of the Presidential office. Marshall’s recognition of the special character of the Presidential office was expanded in Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 12 Pet. 524, 610 (1838), where the Court seemed to deny that it had any jurisdiction over the President: 'The executive power is vested in a president; and so far as his powers are derived from the constitution, he is beyond the reach of any other department, except in the mode prescribed by the constitution through the impeachment.' It is significant that this apparent total disclaimer of any judicial authority over the President also was qualified by adding the clause 'so far as his powers are derived from the constitution.' There have been countless examples in which courts have assumed jurisdiction to scrutinize the validity of Presidential action, such as proclamations, Executive orders, and even direct instructions by the President to his subordinates. t is true that, as a matter of convention the party asserting the validity of the Presidential action (whether plaintiff or defendant) is usually a party other than the President, such as his subordinate, or the custodian of the res. Nevertheless there have been recent dicta that when this convention is inadequate to protect the citizen, i.e., where the President alone can give the requested relief, the courts may assume jurisdiction over the litigation. See the June 25, 1973 memorandum, Appendix iii-iv. Again, Attorney General Stanbery's famous oral argument in Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475; 481-491 (1867), on which the Brief in Opposition by the Attorneys for the President in In Re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, etc., D.C. Misc. 47-73, relies so heavily, is prefaced by the statement that the case made against President Johnson 'is not made against him as an individual, as a natural person, for any acts he intends to do as Andrew Johnson the man, but altogether in his official capacity as President of the United States.' Hence, Attorney General Stanbery's reasoning is presumably limited to the power of the courts to review official action of the President, and does not pertain to the question whether or not the courts lack the authority to deal with the President 'the man' with respect to matter [*24] which have no relation to his official responsibility. Thus it appears that under our constitutional plan it cannot be said either that the courts have the same jurisdiction over the President as if he were an ordinary citizen or that the President is absolutely immune from the jurisdiction of the courts in regard to any kind of claim. The proper approach is to find the proper balance between the normal functions of the courts and the special responsibilities and functions of the Presidency. B. Competing Interests. An assessment designed to determine the extent to which the status of the Presidency is inconsistent with giving the courts plenary criminal jurisdiction over the President may be divided into two parts. First, the applicability vel non to the Presidency of any of the consideration which in Part I of this memorandum led to rejection of the proposition that impeachment must precede criminal proceedings, and, second, whether criminal proceedings and execution of potential sentences would improperly interfere with the President’s constitutional duties and be inconsistent with his status. 1. Is court trial of a President too political for the judicial process? Part I of this memorandum, for a variety of reasons, concluded that the considerations which led to the establishment of the congressional impeachment jurisdiction, e.g., that the courts were not well equipped to handle (a) political offenses and (b) crimes committed by high officeholders, were insufficient to exempt every officer of the United States from criminal prosecution for statutory offenses prior to the termination of the impeachment proceedings. The question to the termination of the impeachment proceedings. The question to be examined here is whether these reason are so much stronger in the case of the President as to preclude his prosecution while in office. a. Political offenses. Political offenses subject to indictment are either statutory or nonstatutory offenses. The courts, of course, cannot adjudicate nonstatutory offenses. With respect to statutory political offenses their very inclusion in the Penal Code is an indication of a congressional determination that they can be adjudicated by a judge and jury, [*25] and there appears to be no weighty reason to differentiate between the President and other officeholders, unless special separation of powers based interests can be articulated with clarity. It should be noted that it has been well established in civil matters that the courts lack jurisdiction to reexamine the exercise of discretion by an officer of the Executive branch. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 166 (1803); Decatur v. Paulding, 14 Pet. 497, 514-517 (1840); Panama Canal Co. v. Grace Line, Inc., 365 U.S. 309, 318 (1958). By the same token it would appear that the courts lack jurisdiction in criminal proceedings which have the effect of questioning the proper exercise of the President’s discretion. This conclusion, of course, would involve a lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter and not over the person. b. Intrinsically political figures. The second reason for the institution of impeachment, viz., the trial of political men, presents more difficulties. The considerations here involved are that the ordinary courts may not be able to cope with powerful men, and second, that it will be difficult to assure a fair trial in criminal prosecutions of this type. i. The consideration that the ordinary courts of law are unable to cope with powerful men arose in England where it presumably was valid in feudal time. In the conditions now prevailing in the United States, little weight is to be given to it as far as most officeholders are concerned. (See Rawle, op. cit., supra, at 211). ii. We also note Alexander Hamilton's point that in well-publicized cases involving high officers, it is virtually impossible to insure a fair trial. In Part I we assumed without discussion that this point was not of sufficient importance to require impeachment prior to indictment with respect to every officeholder. Undoubtedly, the consideration of assuring a fair criminal trial for a President while in office would be extremely difficult. It might be impossible to impanel a neutral jury. To be sure there is a serious [*26] 'fairness' problem whether the criminal trial precedes or follows impeachment. However, the latter unfairness is contemplated and accepted in the impeachment clause itself, thus suggesting that the difficulty in impaneling a neutral jury should not be viewed, in itself, an absolute bar t indictment of a public figure. 2. Would criminal proceedings against a President be ineffective and inappropriate because of his powers regarding (a) prosecution, (b) Executive privilege, and (c) pardons? The Presidency, however, creates a special situation in view of the control of all criminal proceedings by the Attorney General who serves at the pleasure and normally subject to the direction of the President and the pardoning power vested in the President. See Reply Brief filed by Attorneys for the President in In Re Grand Jury Subpoena, etc. (see supra), 9 Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents 999-1000, and the authorities there cited. Hence, it could be argued that a President’s status as defendant in a criminal case would be repugnant to his office of Chief Executive, which includes the power to oversee prosecutions. In other words, just as a person cannot be a judge in his own case, he cannot be prosecutor and defendant at the same time. This objection would lose some of its persuasiveness where, as in the Watergate case, the President delegates his prosecutorial functions to the Attorney General, who in turn delegates them to a Special Prosecutor. Reply Brief, supra, at 1000, fn. 1. However, none of these delegations is, or legally can be, absolute or irrevocable. Further, the problem of Executive privilege may create the appearance of so serious a conflict of interest as to make it improper that the President should be a defendant in a criminal case. If the President claims the privilege he would be accused of suppressing evidence unfavorable to him. If he fails to do so the charge would be that by making available evidence favorable to him he is prejudicing the ability of future Presidents to claim privilege. And even if all other hurdles are surmounted, he would still possess the pardoning power. 3. Would criminal proceedings unduly interfere in a direct or formal sense with the conduct of the Presidency? a. Personal attendance. It has been indicated above that in the Burr case, President Jefferson claimed the privilege of not having to attend court in person. And it is generally recognized that high government officials are exempted from the duty to attend court in person in order to testify. See our memorandum of June 25, 1973, supra, pp. 7-8. This privilege would appear to be inconsistent with a criminal prosecution which necessarily requires the appearance of the defendant for pleas and trial, as a practical matter. It should be noted that the exemption of high government officials from personal appearance is only the general rule. In Peoples v. United States Department of Agriculture, 427 F.2d 561, 567 (C.A. 1970) the court cautioned that 'subjecting a cabinet officer to oral deposition is not normally countenanced * * *.' (Underscoring supplied). The quashing of a subpoena addressed to the NASA Administrator in Capital Vending Co. v. Baker, 36 F.R.D. 45, 46 (D.C. D.C., 1964), was predicated on the circumstance that the Administrator had no personal knowledge of the event. Personal attendance of high officials has been required in several exceptional cases where the official was directly and personally involved in the events underlying the litigation. Union Savings Bank of Patchogue v. Saxon, 209 F. Supp. 317 (D.C. D.C. 1962), (Comptroller of the Currency); Virgo Corporation v. Paiewonsky, 39 F.R.D. 9, (D.C. V.I., 1965) (Territorial Governor); D.C. Federation of Civic Association v. Volpe, 316 F. Supp. 754, 760 fn. 12 (D.C. D.C., 1970), reversed on other grounds 459 F. 2d 1231 (C.A. D.C., 1972) certiorari denied 405 U.S. 1031 (1973) (Secretary of Transportation). Because a defendant is already personally involved in a criminal case (if total immunity be laid aside), it may be questioned whether the normal privilege of high officials not to attend whether the normal privilege of high officials not to attend court in person applies to criminal proceedings in which the official is a defendant. b. Direct interference with official duties. A necessity to defend a criminal trial and to attend court in connection with it, however, would interfere with the President’s unique official duties, most of which cannot be performed by anyone else. It might be suggested that the same is true with the defense of impeachment proceedings; but this is a risk expressly contemplated by the Constitution, and is a necessary incident of the impeachment process. The Constitutional Convention was aware of this problem but rejected a proposal that the President should be suspended upon impeachment by the House until acquitted by the Senate. During the past century the duties of the Presidency, however, have become so onerous that a President may not be able fully to discharge the powers and duties of his office if he had to defend a criminal prosecution. This might constitute an incapacitation so that under the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Sections 3 or 4, the Vice President becomes Acting President. The same would be true, if a conviction on a criminal charge would result in incarceration. However, under our constitutional plan as outlined in Article I, sec. 3, only the Congress by the formal process of impeachment, and not a court by any process should be accorded the power to interrupt the Presidency or oust an incumbent. [*29] This would suggest strongly that, in view of the unique aspects of the Office of the President, criminal proceedings against a President in office should not go beyond a point where they could result in so serious a physical interference with the President's performance of his official duties that it would amount to an incapacitation. [The non-physical yet practical interferences, in terms of capacity to govern, are discussed infra as the 'fourth question.'] The physical interference consideration, of course, would not be quite as serious regarding minor offenses leading to a short trial and a fine. It has been shown in the June 25, 1973 Memorandum, supra, Appendix, p. i, fn., that Presidents have submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts in connection with traffic offenses. However, in more serious matters, i.e., those which could require the protracted personal involvement of the President in trial proceedings, the Presidency would be derailed if the President were tried prior to removal. A possibility not yet mentioned is to indict a sitting President but defer further proceedings until he is no longer in office. From the standpoint of minimizing direct interruption of official duties--and setting aside the question of the power to govern--this procedure might be a course to be considered. One consideration would be that this procedure would stop the running of the statute of limitations. (For details see pp. 13-14 of Part I of this memorandum.) It is uncertain whether a constitutional conclusion that the President could not be indicted while in office would be viewed as tolling the federal statutes of limitations. While this approach may have a claim to be considered as a solution to the problem from a legalistic point of view, it would overlook the political realities. As will be shown presently, an indictment hanging over the President while he remains in office would damage the institution of the Presidency virtually to the same extent as an actual conviction. To be sure, there could also be damage flowing from unrefuted charges. It also may be noted that the possibility that a President may escape all prosecution by the running of the statute of limitations is not a constitutional matter. The policy regarding statutes of limitation is within legislative control 4. Would initiation or prosecution of criminal proceedings, as a practical matter, unduly impede the power to govern, and also be inappropriate, prior to impeachment, because of the symbolic significance of the Presidency? In Mississippi v. Johnson, supra, Attorney General Stanbery made the following statement: 'It is not upon any peculiar immunity that the individual has who happens to be President; upon any idea that he cannot do wrong; upon any idea that there is any particular sanctity belonging to him as an individual, as is the case with one who has royal blood in his veins; but it is on account of the office that he holds that I say the President of the United States is above the process of any court or the jurisdiction of any court to bring him to account as President.' This may be an overstatement, but surely it contains a kernel of truth, namely that the President is the symbolic head of the Nation. To wound him by a criminal proceeding is to hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus, both in foreign and domestic affairs. It is not to be forgotten that the modern Presidency, under whatever party, has had to assume a leadership role undreamed of in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The spectacle of an indicted President still trying to serve as Chief Executive boggles the imagination. Perhaps this thought is best tested by considering what would flow from the reverse conclusion, i.e., an attempted criminal trial of the President. A President after all is selected in a highly complex nationwide effort that involves most of the major socio-economic and political forces of our whole society. Would it not be incongruous to bring him down, before the Congress has acted, by a jury of twelve, selected by chance 'off the street' as Holmes put it? Surely the House and Senate, via impeachment, are more appropriate agencies for such a crucial task, made unavoidably political by the nature of the 'defendant.' The genius of the jury trial has been that it provides a forum of ordinary people to pass on matters generally within the experience or contemplation of ordinary, everyday life. Would it be fair to such an agency to give it responsibility for an unavoidably political judgment in the esoteric realm of the Nation's top Executive? In broader context we must consider also the problems of fairness, and of acceptability of the verdict. Given the passions and exposure that surround the most important office in the world, the American Presidency, would the country in general have faith in the impartiality and sound judgment of the twelve jurors selected by chance out of a population of more than 200 million? If based on 'some' evidence it is unlikely a guilty verdict would be reversible on appeal (assuming no procedural error), and yet it could be tantamount to removal and probability would force a resignation. Even if there were an acquittal, would it be generally accepted and leave the President with effective power to govern? A President who would face jury trial rather than resign could be expected to persist to the point of appealing an adverse verdict. The process could then drag out for months. By contrast the authorized process of impeachment is well-adapted to achieving a relatively speedy and final resolution by a nation-based Senate trial. The whole country is represented at the trial, there is no appeal from the verdict, and removal opens the way for placing the political system on a new and more healthy foundation. To be sure it is arguable that despite the foregoing analysis it would be possible to indict a President, but defer trial until he was out of office, without in the meantime unduly impeding the power to govern, and the symbolism on which so much of his real authority rests. Given the realities of modern politics and mass media, and the delicacy of the political relationships which surround the Presidency both foreign and domestic, there would be a Russian roulette aspect to the course of indicting the President but postponing trial, hoping in the meantime that the power to govern could survive. A counter-argument which could be made is that the indictment alone should force a resignation, thus avoiding the trauma either of a trial during office, or an impeachment proceeding. This counter-argument, however, rests on a prediction concerning Presidential response which empirical foundation. The reasons underlying the Founding Fathers’ decision to reject the notion that a majority of the House of Representatives could suspend the President by impeaching him (see fn. 23, supra) apply with equal force in a scheme that would permit a majority of a grand jury to force the resignation of a President. The resultant disturbance to our constitutional system would be equally enormous. Indeed, it would be more injudicious because the grand jury, a secret body, could interrupt Presidential succession without affording the incumbent the opportunity for a hearing to voice his defense. A further factor relevant here is the President’s role as guardian and executor of the four-year popular mandate expressed in the most recent balloting for the Presidency. Under our developed constitutional order, the presidential election is the only national election, and there is no effective substitute for it. Different electorates and markedly different voting patterns produce the Senate and the House of Representatives. Because only the President can receive and continuously discharge the popular mandate expressed quadrennially in the presidential election, an interruption would be politically and constitutionally a traumatic event. The decision to terminate this mandate, therefore, is more fittingly handled by the Congress than by a jury, and such congressional power is founded in the Constitution. In suggesting that an impeachment proceeding is the only appropriate way to deal with a President while in office, we realize that there are certain drawbacks, such as the running of a statute of limitations while the President is in office, thus preventing any trial for such offenses. In this difficult area all courses of action have costs and we recognize that a situation of the type just mentioned could cause a complete hiatus in criminal liability. We doubt, however, that this gap in the law is sufficient to overcome the arguments against subjecting a President to indictment and criminal trial while in office. III. Is the Vice President Amenable to Crimnal Proceedings While in Office? In the first part of this memorandum we concluded that as a general proposition the Constitution does not require that an officer of the United States be impeached before criminal proceedings may be instituted against him. In the second part we concluded that by virtue of his unique position under the Constitution the President cannot be the object of criminal proceedings while he is in office. In this third part we are concerned with the question whether there is anything in the position of the Vice President that is equally inconsistent with his amenability to criminal proceedings. We begin by discussing the case of Aaron Burr. Eight months before the expiration of his term, he was indicted for murder in both the New Jersey and New York courts for fatally wounding Alexander Hamilton in a duel on July 11, 1804. B. Mitchell, Alexander Hamilton, 537 (1962). The proceedings in New Jersey were quashed after the Jeffersonians, who became his partisans during the impeachment trial of Judge Samuel Chase over which Burr presided, prevailed upon the New Jersey Governor. Id. at 541. In New York, the grand jury changed the charge from murder to the misdemeanor of sending a challenge and Burr was tried on this charge after his term was over. These facts show one more understanding nearly contemporaneous to the marking of the Constitution to the effect that impeachment need not precede indictment. Surely, had it been thought that a sitting Vice President could not be federally indicted prior to impeachment, on the ground that his duties could be so interrupted, the principle of federal supremacy would have imposed a similar restraint on the states. And yet, while the indictment was strenuously resisted, no claim was made that criminal proceedings were barred until the conclusion of impeachment proceedings. We resort then to an analysis similar to that made with respect to the amenability of the President to criminal proceedings. We based the President’s immunity from criminal proceedings essentially on two grounds. First, that the person who controls criminal prosecutions as the head of the Executive branch, controls part of the evidence as holder of the power of Executive privilege, and is vested with the pardoning power under Article II, section 2, clause 1 of the Constitution, cannot at the same time be a defendant in a criminal case. This set of considerations obviously is not applicable to the Vice President. (See II-B-2). The second reason was the effect of a criminal prosecution on the President’s office. (See II-B-3 and 4.) In that context we examined the unique nature of the President’s duties and the symbolic attributes of his office. The questions now to be examined are (a) whether the Vice President in his own right is vested with constitutional and statutory duties so unique and important that they may not be disturbed by a criminal prosecution and (b) whether such prosecution would do irreparable harm to the institution of the Presidency because the Vice President may at any time become President, i.e., a theory of Vice Presidential immunity derivative from Presidential immunity. In making that evaluation we start out from the premise that immunity from prosecution is basically contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and it may be resorted to only if the considerations leading to it are irrefutable. A. Duties of the Vice President pursuant to Statute, Reorganization Plan, or Executive Order. The Vice President serves on a number of Boards and Commissions pursuant to statute, Reorganization Plan or Executive order. He is a member of the Establishment of the Smithsonian Institution, a Regent thereof, and presides over certain meetings of the members of the Institution in the absence of the President. 20 U.S.C. 41, 42, 45. He is the Chairman of the National Council on marine Resources and Engineering Development (33 U.S.C. 1102), and a member [*35] of the National Security Council (50 U.S.C. 402). In addition, he is a member of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Policy (Executive Order No. 11453); Chairman of the National Council on Indian Opportunity (Executive Order No. 11399, as amended by Executive Order No. 11551); and Chairman of the President’s Council on Youth Opportunity (Executive Order No. 11330, as amended by Executive Order No. 11547). He has “immediate supervision” over the Office of Intergovernmental Relations (Executive Order No. 11455), and is a member of the Domestic Council (Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, sec. 201). The operations of none of those governmental entities would be jeopardized if the Vice President could not attend them. Regarding such functions the role of the Vice President can be analogized to that of a cabinet officer. B. Duties of the Vice President under the Constitution Under the Constitution the Vice President has the following duties: i. He shall be President of the Senate. Article I, section 3, clause 4. The Senate, however, shall elect a President pro tempore to act as President of the Senate in the event the Vice President is absent or exercises the Office of the President. (Article I, section 3, clause 5). ii. Break a tie if the Senate is evenly divided. (Article I, section 3, clause 4). iii. Become President in the case of the removal, death or resignation of the President (Twenty-fifth Amendment, section 1). iv. Become Acting President in the event that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office (Twenty-fifth Amendment, secs. 3 and 4). The Vice President's functions as President of the Senate clearly are not unique. The Constitution specifically provides [*36] for a substitute in the person of the President pro tempore of the Senate. With respect to his responsibility as tie breaker his immunity from criminal prosecution should be analogized to that of Members of Congress under Article I, section 6, clause 1 of the Constitution. That congressional immunity from arrest does not extend to treason, felony, and breach of the peace, i.e., virtually the entire spectrum of criminal proceedings. The mere possibility that the Vice President may have to cast a tie-breaking vote would therefore not justify his immunity from criminal proceedings. This leaves the question whether the responsibilities and the position of the Vice President as potential President or Acting President are inconsistent with his amenability to criminal proceedings, so that on a derivative basis he would share the President’s immunity. As in the case of the Presidency, this issue will be analyzed (a) in terms of the direct interference with the performance of his duties and functions, and (b) with the symbolic impact on the dignity of the Presidency. 1. Direct or formal interference with the conduct of the Vice Presidency. The issue here is whether immediate availability of the Vice President to assume the duties of the President or Acting President is so important that he should not be even temporarily incapacitated by trial or possible incarceration. (The Vice President would become President in event of death, resignation or removal of the President, and would become Acting President in the event the President were found under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to be incapacitated.) The principal responsibility of the Vice President is to be ready to serve as President or Acting President should the occasion arise, thereby avoiding any interruption in the continuity of the office of the President. This duty “to stand and wait” is of the highest constitutional and institutional importance. Judicial proceedings which could interfere with readiness to serve therefore require careful scrutiny. At the same time we must note the highly contingent nature of the possibility that the Vice President would be called to assume the office of President or Acting President. Moreover, it has not been the custom to sequester the Vice President to make certain that he is always available to assume his potential Presidential duties at a moment’s notice. The Vice President is frequently absent from the capital, possibly in remove and inaccessible parts of the country, or even abroad on ceremonial functions. Nothing, of course, can prevent him from being sick or otherwise temporarily incapacitated. Under such a practical interpretation of the extent of the Vice President's immediate availability, it appears as a general proposition that his duty to stand and wait does not necessarily require his total immunity from criminal prosecution. If the Office of the Presidency was vacated while a criminal proceeding was being conducted against the Vice President, the process could be halted at once. Whether or not impeachment proceedings would then ensure against the former Vice President, now President, would depend on the will of Congress. The situation then would be exactly the same as if the Vice President had been President when the allegations of criminality first surfaced -- no better, no worse. Thus, a criminal indictment against a Vice President need not abrogate in any way his constitutional duty to stand and wait. This duty, therefore, does not afford a basis for granting to a Vice President immunity from criminal prosecution. As a further practice observation, it may be noted that if a trial of the Vice President proceeded to a sentence of imprisonment, and were sustained in what might be expected to be an expeditious appeal, the Vice President might well resign. He could be replaced under the Twenty-fifth Amendment's procedure for filling a 'vacancy' in the office of Vice President. Thus, the uninterruptibility of the Presidency would be preserved. There is, of course, no provision in the Constitution (other than impeachment and removal) for determining that a Vice President is incapacitated. The Constitution contains such incapacity-determination process only for the Presidency. Institution of criminal proceedings against the Vice President could, however, inject uncertainties into the Presidential succession. If a Vice President is under indictment or sentence of imprisonment, it could be claimed that he is incapacitated to succeed to the Presidency, and that the Speaker of the House of Representatives is next in line of succession. In that event the political stability of the nation could be seriously disrupted as the result of the failure of the Constitution to provide a procedure to resolve that question. The matter would come to a head if an actual vacancy in the Presidency should then occur. No one can foresee all of the contingencies which might arise in this situation. It might be reasonable to speculate that the Congress might claim an authoritative power in itself to resolve the matter, but if it did so by any vote falling short of the two-thirds Senate vote required to remove by the impeachment process, further uncertainties could ensue. Alternatively, the situation might give rise to a modern analogy to the Electoral Commission which was set up to resolve the Hayes-Tilden dispute. To be sure, any action which could cast a doubt on the Vice President's capacity to succeed to the Presidency poses a serious question. Nevertheless, there are hazards also in having unresolved criminal charges hanging over the head of a Vice President, and the foregoing set of difficult scenarios is highly contingent. We suggest, therefore, that the rather remote possibility that the Vice President’s capacity might be questioned would not justify a conclusion that the Vice President is immune from criminal prosecution. 2. Practical interference with the power to govern and the symbolic significance of the Vice Presidency.--Turning now from the question of direct and formal interferences to the issue of symbolic and other practical interferences with the power to govern (as discussed in Part II-B-4), it may be observed that if it is felt these latter considerations are german for the President, they are also germane for the Vice President, although possibly to a lesser degree. Clearly the authority of the Presidency would suffer immeasurably were it to pass to a Vice President under indictment or to one 'taken from criminal custody by a set of curious chances,' to paraphrase the Mikado. But the damage could be similar--or even more serious--if the Presidency passed to a Vice President against whom serious charges were in everyone’s mouth and who could neither be brought to justice nor given an opportunity to clear himself. Again, because of the contingent nature of Vice Presidential succession to the Presidency, we feel that the potential problems in this area too should be faced and solved by political [or other] means as they occur, rather than be ignored under a theory of total immunity from criminal prosecution. If, for example, actual or threatened criminal prosecution should result in a resignation, the Vice Presidential office could be refilled by the procedures of the Twenty-fifth Amendment. 3. Evaluation.--There is one fundamental recurring problem in the above discussion. Should the Vice President be treated as if he were the President himself or his alter ego, because he is only one heart beat away from taking that position? Alternatively, should the stress be placed on the contingent nature of his assumption of the Presidential office? A reasonable approach toward the solution of this dilemma would be the consideration that the criminal prosecution would not directly and immediately interfere with the performance of the Presidential duties and with the Presidential office itself, but rather with the Vice President’s ability to succeed to the Presidency and the effect thereof on that institution. As indicated above, the prosecution of a Vice President would not legally or actually preclude his assumption of the Presidential duties because the proceedings could always be interrupted in that event. The problem therefore is basically of a political nature, viz., whether a Vice President against whom criminal charges have been made, who perhaps has been indicted, and who perhaps has been convicted can effectively perform the duties of the President. This political question is not solved by providing for immunity from criminal prosecution. Even if there were no indictment and trial, the very existence of those charges would hamper the Vice President in the performance of his Presidential duties almost as much as if he were tried and convicted. Indeed, he might be in a better position if he were able to vindicate himself before a court while he is Vice President. In sum, although one cannot entirely be free from doubt in this unprecedented area, it is, nevertheless, concluded that case for granting the Vice President immunity from criminal prosecution has not been made. Having established the proposition that the Vice President does not share the immunity suggested for the President, because the various considerations which support such immunity do not relate directly to the Vice President, the public interest in going forward with investigation and possible indictment of the Vice President is supported strongly by two additional factors. a. The alleged presence of co-conspirators We understand that there are allegations to the effect that the Vice President was a member of a conspiracy. If true, there is a substantial public interest in including the Vice President in the on-going investigation and possible indictment proceedings. Failure to do so might not only preclude the opportunity to bring co-conspirators to justice, but also [*41] prejudice the Vice President. The prosecution also would be severely hampered by the withholding from the grand jury of those elements of the alleged conspiracy linked to the Vice President. As a result the activities of the alleged co-conspirators could not be fully disclosed and evaluated, which might redound unfairly to their benefit. At the same time, the Vice President might be unfairly linked by innuendo or incomplete disclosure of facts to the alleged conspiracy. In short any resultant delay in the proceedings would benefit the co-conspirators, hamper the prosecution, and postpone a possible exoneration of the Vice President. b. The statute of limitations problem Another circumstance counselling prompt presentation of evidence to the grand jury is that the statute of limitations is about to bar the prosecution of the alleged offenders with respect to some or all of the offenses. The problem presented by the statute of limitations would be avoided by an indictment within the statutorily specified period. After indictment, the question whether the Government should press for immediate trial or delay prosecution until the expiration of the Vice President’s duties involves questions of trial strategy (e.g., relation to possible co-conspirators as just discussed) and criminal procedure (e.g., right to a speedy trial) which other Divisions may be more competent to evaluate in the light of all of the facts. Robert G. Dixon, Jr. Assistant Attorney General Office of Legal Counsel For a discussion of the definition of 'civil officer' as that term is used in Article II, section 4 of the Constitution, see pp. 8-9 infra. We are using the term 'termination of the impeachment proceedings' rather than 'removal by way of impeachment' in view of the statement in Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, Vol. I, sec. 782, quoted below, that criminal proceedings may be instituted, either after an acquittal or conviction in the court of impeachment. The conclusion that acquittal by the Senate does not bar criminal prosecution follows from the consideration that such an acquittal may be based, as discussed infra, on jurisdictional grounds, e.g., that the defendant is not an officer of the United States in the constitutional sense, or on discretionary grounds, e.g., that the defendant no longer is an officer of the United States and unlikely to be reappointed or reelected, or on ground which are partly jurisdictional and partly substantive, e.g., that the offense was not of an impeachable nature. This provision was rendered necessary because the Constitution limits the judgment of impeachment to removal and disqualification, while under English law the house of Lords did also impose severe criminal sanctions including the death penalty, in cases of conviction on impeachment. Story, op. cit., Vol. I, §§ 784, 785; Rawle, A View of the Constitution, p. 217. The Constitution of the United States, Analysis and Interpretation, S. Doc. No. 39, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 556; H. Rept. 1639, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 38-39. See the dismissal of the proceedings against Senator Blount and former Secretary of War Belknap, and H. Rept. 1639, supra, pp. 1-2. Commerce Judge Archbald was investigated by the Department of Justice prior to his impeachment in 1912. It is, however, not apparent whether this was a formal grand jury investigation. Carpenter, Judicial Tenure in the United States, 145; Shogan, A Question of Judgment, 232. A retired judge remains in office; he possesses the right to receive the salary of his office and retains the capacity to perform judicial functions upon designation and assignment. 28 U.S.C. 294. It is questionable whether the usual exception of the ad hoc position from the term 'office' is applicable to the impeachment power; this raises the question whether, for instance, a Presidential agent appointed to performa single diplomatic mission (S. Doc. 39, supra, pp. 499-501) could be impeached for bribery. Malversation has been defined as misbehavior in office. Jowitt, Dictionary of English Law. Section 800 contains a recapitulation of the numerous offenses which in English history had been subject to impeachment. They included: Misleading the King with unconstitutional opinions; attempts to subvert the fundamental laws, and introduce arbitrary powers ;attaching the great seal to an ignominious treaty; neglect to safeguard the sea by a lord admiral; betrayal of his trust by an ambassador, propounding and supporting pernicious and dishonorable measures by a privy counsellor; the receipt of exorbitant grants and incompatible employments by a confidential adviser to the King. While Story felt that certain impeachments were unduly harsh and understandable only in the light of their age, such as giving bad counsel to the king, advising a prejudicial peace, enticing the king to act against the advice of Parliament, purchasing offices, giving medicine to the king without advice of physicians, preventing other persons from giving counsel to the king except in their presence, and procuring exorbitant personal grants from the king, he suggested that others were founded in the most salutary public justice; such as impeachments for malversations and neglects in office, for encouraging pirates, for official oppression, extortions, and deceits, and especially for putting good magistrates out of office and advancing bad ones. Congressman Summers, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who was the Manager of the impeachment of district judge Halsted Ritter in 1936 viewed the impeachment function as depending on the effect of the offense on the office: 'We do not assume the responsibility . . . of proving that the respondent is guilty of a crime as that term is known to criminal jurisprudence. We do assume the responsibility of brining before you a case, proven facts, the reasonable and probable consequences of which are to cause people to doubt the integrity of the respondent presiding as a judge.' 80 Cong. Rec. 5469, 5602-06 (74th Cong. 2d Sess. 1936). In his speech of March 5, 1800 on the floor of the Senate, Senator Pickney, a former Member of the Constitutional Convention, suggested that the failure to provide for a Presidential immunity was deliberate. Annals of Congress, 6th Cong., col. 74; Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention Vol. III, pp. 384, 385. The Federalist, No. 69: 'The President [unlike the King] would be liable to be impeached, tried, and upon conviction * * * removed from office; and would afterwards be liable to the prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.' See also the following from Hamilton. The Federalist, No. 65: 'The punishment, which may be the consequence of conviction upon impeachment, is not to terminate the chastisement of the offender. After having been sentenced to perpetual ostracism * * *; he will still be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.' The Federalist, No. 77: 'The President is at all times liable to impeachment, trial, dismission from office * * * and to the forfeiture of life and estate by subsequent prosecution in the common course of law.' The Framers of the Constitution made it abundantly clear that the President was intended to be a Chief Executive, responsible, subject to the law, and lacking the prerogatives and privileges of the King of England. See, e.g., James Wilson's statements that the prerogatives of the British monarch were not to be a proper guide in defining Executive powers (Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention Vol. I, p. 65) and that the President would not be above the law, nor have a single privilege annexed to his character. 2 Elliot's Debates 480. In the North Carolina Convention, James Iredell contrasted the position of the King of England who holds his authority by birthright, has great powers and prerogatives, and can do no wrong, with that of the President who is no better than his fellow citizens and can pretend no superiority over the meanest man in the country. 4 Elliot's Debates 109. See, e.g., President Washington's refusal in 1794 to submit to the Senate those parts of a diplomatic correspondence which in his 'judgment for public considerations, ought not to be communicated.' 1 Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents 152; 1 Senate Executive Journal 147. See Attorney General Randolph’s note to President Washington that the message 'appears to have given general satisfaction. Mr. M--d--n, in particular thinks it will have good effect.' The Writings of George Washington (Bicentennial Edition) Vol. 33 p. 282 fn 8. See also Chief Justice Marshall's statement in the Burr treason trial 'to issue a subpoena to a person filling the exalted position of the chief magistrate is a duty which would be dispensed with more cheerfully than it would be performed.' Id. at p. 34. See, e.g., United States v. Curtiss-Wright, 299 U.S. 304 (1936) (Embargo Proclamation); United States v. Bush, 310 U.S. 371 (1940) (Customs Proclamation). Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) (Steel Seizure). It may well be that under the normally operative procedural rules the President would be considered the real party in interest or a necessary party. 9 Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents 961, 963, 970. In the eyes of the Court, the dismissal of the proceedings was based on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter rather than over the person of the President. This is shown by its dismissal of similar proceedings brought by the State of George against Secretary of War Stanton and General Grant. 6 Wall. 50 and 451 (1867). 'The prosecution of them [i.e., political crimes committed by political men] for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In [*26] many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greater danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.' The Federalist, No. 65 (Hamilton). That decision was based in part on the consideration that a simple majority of the House should not be able to suspend the President. 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention 612. Tucker's Blackstone, Vol. I, App., pp. 347-348, which, having been published in 1803, did not have the benefit of the Madison papers, presumed that a President would be instantly incapacitated when actually impeached. See Story, op. cit., sec. 786. As shown above, the statute of limitations problem could be obviated by a specific statutory provision suspending the running of the criminal statute of limitations in favor of the President while he is in office. He remained a fugitive from the courts of New York during the remainder of his term as Vice-President. Mitchell, supra, at 541. In Tennessee v. Davis, 100 U.S. 257 (1879), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a statute removing to federal courts state criminal prosecutions of federal employees for acts committed under color of office. 33 U.S.C. 1102(c) authorizes the President to designate one of the members of the council to preside over its meetings during the absence, disability, or unavailability of the Chairman. Note the delay in reaching Vice President Coolidge on his father's farm after President Harding's death. To recapitulate we conclude that the President must be denied that opportunity to vindicate himself because that would interfere with the performance of his official duties, and inevitably be inconsistent with his control of the prosecution and the pardoning power."

    "content": "MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER SPORKIN, District Judge. Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, was incarcerated at a federal correctional facility in Milan, Michigan at the time this action was commenced. He brings this action pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (1977 & Supp. I 1990) [hereinafter 'FOIA'], and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (1977 & Supp. I 1990) [hereinafter 'PA'], seeking documents allegedly held by defendants the Department of Justice ('DOJ'), the United States Attorney's Offices ['USAO'] for the Southern District of Florida and the Eastern District of Missouri,1 the United States Parole Commission ['Parole Commission'], the Executive Office of the United States Attorney ['EOUSA'] and the United States Bureau of Prisons ['BOP']. Plaintiff also seeks attorney's and researcher's fees, and costs. This matter is before the Court on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.2Plaintiff submits exhibits in support of his motion.3 Defendants Parole Commission, BOP, and the EOUSA submit affidavits and exhibits in support of their motions.I. FACTUAL BACKGROUNDPlaintiff brings a seven count complaint which alleges that each of the defendants failed to comply with his requests for information pursuant to the FOIA and the PA.A. FOIA/PA Requests to the Department of JusticeIn a letter dated December 26, 1987, plaintiff made a request to the DOJ for a copy of his pre-sentence investigation report. Complaint ¶ 5; Plaintiff's Exhibit ['Pl.Ex.'] pp. 1–3 to his Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. The DOJ allegedly responded that there would be a delay in processing his request due to a backlog created by similar requests. Complaint ¶ 6. The DOJ subsequently forwarded plaintiff's request for his pre-sentence investigation *32 report to the Parole Commission4 (Pl.Ex. p. 21) which in turn forwarded the request to its North Central Regional Office ['Regional Office'] in Kansas City, Missouri. This Regional Office processes 'first party' disclosure requests from persons within the jurisdiction where plaintiff Harvey was then an inmate (the federal correctional facility in Milan, Michigan). The Regional Office informed plaintiff that it lacked a parole file on him and that one would not be established until after his initial parole hearing. United States Parole Commission Exhibit ['USPC Ex.'] 3 (attachment to USPC Motion).B. FOIA/PA Requests to the United States Parole CommissionPlaintiff submitted undated letters to defendant Parole Commission which requested 'any and all information in connection to his name.' McLeod Dec. ¶ 6, 7. These requests were forwarded to the Regional Office which advised plaintiff that no records existed which pertained to him. Id., USPC Ex. 5, 7. The Regional Office informed plaintiff that the Parole Commission lacked a parole file on him and that one would not be established until approximately two weeks after his initial parole hearing. USPC Motion at 1–2, USPC Ex. 5, 7. Plaintiff's initial parole hearing was scheduled for July, 1988. During this parole hearing the parties determined that further information was needed. Therefore, the hearing was postponed to complete the record. Subsequent to filing this action, plaintiff requested a copy of the audio tape of the above referenced hearing. USPC Ex. 8. Plaintiff asked that the tape be sent to his attorney, James McMasters, in Coral Gables, Florida. McLeod Dec. ¶ 8. A parole file was established for plaintiff at about this time. Id. In a letter dated August 30, 1988, Michael Antonelli, a paralegal, submitted a second request on plaintiff's behalf for 'all documents' in plaintiff's file. Id. ¶ 10, USPC Ex. 10. On December 12, 1988, the Parole Commission released seventy-four pages of documents and a copy of the audio tape of plaintiff's partial parole hearing. Id. ¶ 13, USPC Ex. 13. The Parole Commission asserts that this material is all that was contained in plaintiff's parole file at that time. On March 22, 1989, the Parole Commission advised plaintiff that it received 967 pages of documents from Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Fagan. McLeod Dec. ¶ 16. The Parole Commission informed plaintiff that if he wanted copies of this new material under the FOIA/PA, he would have to submit payment in the amount of $86.70 to cover reproduction costs. Plaintiff then requested 'a copy of everything you have in the regional file, except the newly arrived 967 pages from Fagan[.]' USPC Ex. 19. The Parole Commission processed this request and released an additional seventy-seven pages but excluded the 967 pages as instructed by plaintiff.5 McLeod Dec. ¶ 18, USPC Ex. 20. In sum, defendant Parole Commission submits that it released all of the material responsive to plaintiff's requests that existed in his parole file as of December 1988, including a second audio tape and seventy-seven additional pages in response to new requests. USPC Motion at 1, McLeod Dec. ¶ 20. C. FOIA/PA Requests to the United States Attorney's Offices and to the Executive Offices for United States AttorneysPlaintiff made undated requests to the USAOs in Fort Lauderdale and Miami, *33 Florida (the Southern District of Florida), seeking 'information in connection to [him].' Complaint ¶ 8 & 11; Pl.Ex. pp. 5–6. In a letter dated May 2, 1988, the USAO for the Southern District of Florida acknowledged plaintiff's request and advised him that it was referred to the EOUSA. Pl.Ex. p. 45. Plaintiff also made undated requests to defendant USAO in St. Louis, Missouri (the Eastern District of Missouri), seeking grand jury information and 'all information in connection to him.' Complaint ¶ 14–15; Pl.Ex. pp. 7–8. This request was also referred to the EOUSA. Declaration of Virginia L. Wright ['Wright Dec.'] ¶ 6 (attachment to Motion of Defendant Executive Office for the United States Attorneys for Summary Judgment); Pl.Ex. p. 15. Plaintiff appealed the delays in responding to his requests. Complaint ¶ 16, Pl.Ex. pp. 9–10. The EOUSA accepted the responsibility to respond to plaintiff's requests for information from the United States Attorney's Offices for the Southern District of Florida and the Eastern District of Missouri. Plaintiff then received a letter from the EOUSA dated May 19, 1988, which advised him that his request would be handled as soon as possible. Complaint ¶ 19; Pl.Ex. p. 15. 1. Request to the USAO for the E.D. of MissouriOn September 16, 1988, the EOUSA informed plaintiff that a search undertaken in the USAO for the Eastern District of Missouri revealed that he was the subject of a pending law enforcement proceeding. Wright Dec. ¶ 10(a), EOUSA Ex. F. The EOUSA withheld the six boxes of records relying on FOIA exemption (b)(7)(A), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A). Wright Dec. ¶ 10(a), EOUSA Ex. F. The EOUSA asserts that these records pertained to plaintiff's impending trial and that; plaintiff received most of this material during pre-trial discovery; he had access to all of the transcripts relevant to the proceedings; and, that as a result of his impending trial, segregation of the records could not be done at the same time as trial preparation. Wright Dec. ¶ 10(a). Plaintiff was also advised that a disclosure determination would be made on these records upon completion of his pending criminal trial. Id. Although this criminal case is closed, plaintiff is in the process of appealing his conviction. Id. ¶ 36. The EOUSA asserts that it will make a disclosure determination on the six boxes of documents upon receipt of copying fees currently owed by plaintiff. Id. 2. Request to the USAO for the S.D. of FloridaOn September 16, 1988, the EOUSA informed plaintiff that a search in the USAO for the Southern District of Florida revealed eight cases, criminal and civil, responsive to plaintiff's request. Id. ¶ 10(b), EOUSA Ex. F. Plaintiff was advised that two case files which could not be located would be processed upon their discovery, and that records of a civil case pending against plaintiff were not provided to avoid charging fees for material he may already possess, and to prevent duplication of material of which he could gain access from the Clerk of the Court. Wright Dec. ¶ 10(b)(1)–(2). Plaintiff was also advised that the remaining five case files consisted of 397 pages of USAO documents which were accorded the following treatment: 182 pages were entirely withheld pursuant to FOIA exemptions, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5) & (7)(D); three pages were partially excised pursuant to another FOIA exemption, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C); and 212 pages were released in their entirety to plaintiff. Id. ¶ 10(b)(3), EOUSA Ex. F. Grand jury records located in one of the five cases were withheld pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3). Wright Dec. ¶ 10(b)(3). Other records sought by plaintiff which originated in other components within the DOJ were referred to the proper offices. Finally, plaintiff was informed that the processing fee for duplicating the 215 released pages was $11.50. Since the time the EOUSA first responded to plaintiff's FOIA requests additional information has been obtained. First, in further reviewing the records pertaining to the six criminal and civil matters described above, the EOUSA uncovered 200 pages of *34 state court records that may be obtained by plaintiff for $.10 per page. Id. ¶ 32. Second, the EOUSA has been advised about the two missing files. A criminal case was being prosecuted by the IRS against plaintiff at the time the EOUSA filed its motion. Wright Dec. ¶ 33. United States Attorney's Office files pertaining to that case are held by the IRS. The USAO for the Southern District of Florida located two 'dummy files' which consist of an appellate brief, a file jacket cover and various court filings. The EOUSA asserts that it will process the dummy files and the documents held by the IRS upon completion of plaintiff's appeal and receipt of his payment. Id. Finally, the Southern District of Florida's USAO found two additional matters concerning plaintiff that are still pending. The USAO received these cases at about the same time plaintiff made his FOIA/PA requests and asserts that a disclosure determination will be made upon receipt of plaintiff's fee payment. Id. ¶ 35. 3. EOUSA ResponseOn September 16, 1988, a package containing the released documents was sent to plaintiff. This package was returned to the EOUSA on two occasions marked 'return to sender' and 'left no forwarding address.' After these unsuccessful attempts to reach plaintiff, the Clerk of the Court was contacted to verify plaintiff's address. Upon obtaining a new address, these documents were again sent to plaintiff. Wright Dec. ¶ 12, EOUSA Ex. G. On March 28, 1989, plaintiff was advised that the EOUSA would not continue processing his FOIA/PA requests unless the $11.50 duplication charges were paid. Id. ¶ 13, EOUSA Ex. H. D. FOIA/PA Requests to the Federal Bureau of PrisonsIn letters dated October 29, 1987, and November 11, 1987, plaintiff sent requests to Dick Clark, the Associate Warden, and to the Records Department of the Federal Correctional Institution at Milan, Michigan, for 'information in connection to his name,' and for every financial record pertaining to all of the inmates presently and formerly housed in 'H' dorm. Complaint ¶ 27; Pl.Ex. pp. 27–29, 32–34. By letters dated December 28, 1987, and January 22, 1988, Clair A. Cripe, General Counsel of the BOP, acknowledged plaintiff's requests and advised him to first review all releasable records locally and, if further access was desired, to submit his requests to BOP's FOIA office in Washington, D.C. Pl.Ex. pp. 37, 44; Declaration of C.B. Faulkner ¶ 5, BOP Ex. B. Plaintiff's requests were referred from BOP's Office of General Counsel to its Regional Office. Faulkner Dec. ¶ 6, BOP Ex. C. On August 25, 1988, the Regional Office informed plaintiff that certain records were releasable. Faulkner Dec. ¶ 8, BOP Ex. E. It also informed plaintiff that he could review and obtain copies of these records at the federal facility where he was imprisoned. Eleven pages of documents were either withheld in full or in part from plaintiff pursuant to claimed FOIA exemptions. Faulkner Dec. ¶ 9. II. STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENTSummary judgment may be granted only 'if the pleadings, ... together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.' Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In reviewing a motion for summary judgment the court must consider the pleadings, related documents and evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. Adickes v. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1608, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). 'If the motion for summary judgment is properly supported, the burden shifts to the non-movant to ‘set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.' ' Laningham v. United States Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, 1241 (D.C.Cir.1987) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). An issue is genuine only if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party. If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted. *35 Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 249–250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510–11, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). III. DISCUSSIONA. Documents Allegedly Withheld by the DOJ and the Parole CommissionCount I of the complaint asserts that the DOJ denied plaintiff's FOIA/PA request for a copy of his pre-sentence investigation report. This request was forwarded by DOJ to the Parole Commission. Count VI alleges that the Parole Commission failed to process plaintiff's requests for 'all information in connection to his name.' Therefore, the Court first addresses Counts I and VI which, in effect, challenge the actions taken by the Parole Commission.  The Parole Commission contends that it released all materials found in plaintiff's parole file on December 12, 1988, and that this disclosure satisfied his numerous FOIA/PA requests and renders this lawsuit moot as to it.6 McLeod Dec. ¶ 13, USPC Ex. 13. The Parole Commission also informed plaintiff that it received 967 pages of documents concerning him subsequent to December 17, 1988, from Assistant U.S. Attorney Fagan. McLeod Dec. ¶ 16. This material was incorporated into plaintiff's parole file and has since been made available to him. USPC Motion at 2. However these documents came into the Parole Commission's possession subsequent to its receipt of the initial requests and to the initiation of this lawsuit. Therefore, they are not germane to this action.7  This Court finds that the Parole Commission processed plaintiff's numerous FOIA/PA requests and provided him with all of the information responsive to his requests, including the presentence investigation report. The Parole Commission released the entire contents of plaintiff's parole file as it existed at the time of its initial response in December of 1988, without excision. This included the audio tape of plaintiff's first incomplete parole hearing of July, 1988. The Parole Commission did not withhold information pursuant to any claimed statutory exemptions. Accordingly, judgment shall be entered against plaintiff as to Counts I and VI of his complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. B. Documents Withheld by the USAO and the EOUSA Counts II and III of the complaint assert that the USAO for the Southern District of Florida failed to respond to plaintiff's requests under the FOIA/PA for 'information in connection to [him].' Count IV alleges that the USAO for the Eastern District of Missouri failed to provide plaintiff with grand jury information which he requested under the FOIA/PA. Count V avers that the DOJ and the EOUSA did not process plaintiff's FOIA/PA requests. As previously discussed, the USAO for the Southern District of Florida located six cases responsive to plaintiff's broad request.8 Of the six cases, a civil case which was pending at the time of his request contained filings and correspondence written by plaintiff or his attorney. This case record was not produced because the EOUSA concluded that plaintiff might already have this information, and the information was available from the Clerk of the Court. Additionally, plaintiff was advised that the *36 EOUSA did not want to unnecessarily expend resources to respond to such a request. The EOUSA did not rely on any FOIA exemption when it withheld this information. Thus, if plaintiff still desires these records the EOUSA must produce them. Of course, plaintiff must absorb the duplication costs. The remaining five cases discovered by the USAO for the Southern District of Florida consisted of 397 pages of internal office documents. Two hundred-twelve pages were released in their entirety, three pages were partially excised pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) and (7)(C), and 182 pages were completely withheld pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5), (6), (7)(C) and (D). Grand jury records located in one of these five cases were withheld pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3). The EOUSA asserts that it excised material from three documents pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) [hereinafter 'Exemption 6'] and (7)(C) [hereinafter 'Exemption 7(C)']. Exemption 6 permits a governmental agency to withhold 'personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.' 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). Exemption 7(C) exempts 'records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that such [material] ... could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,....' 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(C). Pursuant to claimed Exemptions 6 and 7(C), the EOUSA first excised the identity and phone number of a potential trial witness from undated hand written notes. Secondly, the EOUSA excised the identity and phone number of a third party who was referenced in correspondence written by Southern Bell's District Security Manager regarding telephone toll billing records. Finally, the third document excised is a duplicate of the above referenced letter. The EOUSA asserts that it properly excised this material to protect the identities of potential trial witnesses, and the name, address, and telephone number of a third party whose telephone toll billing records had been subpoenaed. Wright Dec. ¶ 24. This Court finds that the non-disclosure of the excised information is supported by Exemption 7(C). To withhold information pursuant to this exemption the EOUSA must first show that the information was ' ‘compiled for law enforcement purposes.' ' King v. Department of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 229 (D.C.Cir.1987) citing FBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615, 622, 102 S.Ct. 2054, 2059, 72 L.Ed.2d 376 (1982) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7) (1982)). Information gathered by the USAO which concerns potential trial witnesses, and a third party whose toll billing records had been subpoenaed satisfies this requirement. Secondly, the agency must demonstrate that 'production would have one of the undesirable effects enumerated by the exemption.' King, supra at 229, citing FBI v. Abramson, supra. Releasing the names and numbers of potential trial witnesses and a third party whose phone records had been subpoenaed 'could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,....' 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C). Exemption 7(C) is applied by balancing the 'privacy interest' against the 'public interest in disclosure.' Keys v. Department of Justice, 830 F.2d 337, 346 (D.C.Cir.1987) citing Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press v. Department of Justice, 816 F.2d 730, 737 (D.C.Cir.1987), rev'd on other grounds, 485 U.S. 1005, 108 S.Ct. 1467, 99 L.Ed.2d 697 (1988). In Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, ––––, 109 S.Ct. 1468, 1485, 103 L.Ed.2d 774 (1989), the Supreme Court held that a 'third party's request for law-enforcement records or information about a private citizen can reasonably be expected to invade that citizen's privacy, and that when the request seeks no ‘official information' about a Government agency ..., the invasion of privacy is ‘unwarranted.' ' Here, the privacy interest of the individuals named in these documents outweighs any public interest in the release of the information. This Court concludes that the EOUSA's reliance on Exemption 7(C) was warranted. *37  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5) [hereinafter 'Exemption 5'], the EOUSA withheld 150 pages of documents. These documents were withheld to protect attorney work-product prepared in anticipation of litigation and to maintain an asserted deliberative process privilege. These documents consist of trial notes, potential witness testimony, evidentiary notes, and telephone notes. Three other pages were withheld in their entirety pursuant to Exemption 5. Two of these pages are an inter-agency memorandum from AUSA Robert O'Neill to Linda Hertz of the Civil Division which concern agency recommendations regarding litigation that involved plaintiff. The third page is a memorandum from Ms. Hertz to Debbie Watson of the Criminal Division regarding litigation that involved plaintiff. Exemption 5 excludes from disclosure any 'inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.' 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). The policies underlying the attorney work-product privilege are 'clearly incorporated into Exemption 5.' NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 160, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 1521, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975). The privilege embodied in Exemption 5 'rest[s] ... upon the policy of protecting the ‘decision-making processes of government agencies.' ' Id. at 150, 95 S.Ct. at 1516 (quoting Tennessean Newspapers, Inc. v. FHA, 464 F.2d 657, 660 (6th Cir.1972)).  'Exemption 5 is intended to protect the deliberative process of government and not just deliberative material (citation omitted).' Wolfe v. Department of Health and Human Services, 839 F.2d 768, 773 (D.C.Cir.1988) (quoting Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 256 (D.C.Cir.1977)). The deliberative process privilege is limited to materials which are pre-decisional and deliberative. EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 88, 93 S.Ct. 827, 836, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973). Although an agency must disclose documents which explain its final decision, it may withhold documents which are pre-decisional. Wolfe, supra at 774 (citations omitted). Attorneys at the USAO for the Southern District of Florida prepared 150 pages of trial notes, evidentiary notes, potential witness testimony and telephone notes in anticipation of litigation involving plaintiff Harvey. The release of these documents would expose the thoughts, decision-making processes and trial strategy of the U.S. Attorneys concerning anticipated litigation against plaintiff. This result would contravene the attorney work-product doctrine and Exemption 5. Accordingly, the EOUSA properly withheld these 150 pages of documents pursuant to Exemption 5.  The remaining three pages contain communications and recommendations made in anticipation of litigation. These three pages of inter-agency memoranda are covered by both the attorney work-product doctrine and the deliberative process privilege. These documents are deliberative because they reflect recommendations and communications concerning the 'decision-making processes of government agencies.' NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., supra. The documents are pre-decisional because they concerned avenues which the agencies contemplated taking in regard to possible litigation involving plaintiff. Therefore, these three inter-agency memoranda were properly withheld by the EOUSA pursuant to Exemption 5.  A letter from AUSA Neil Karadbil to District Attorney Andrew Slater regarding a potential trial witness was withheld by the EOUSA under the authority of Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to allegedly protect a potential trial witness' privacy. This correspondence between state and federal attorneys concerned a potential trial witness and, therefore, this information was compiled for 'law enforcement purposes' within the meaning of Exemption 7(C). Furthermore, application of Exemption 7(C) is appropriate because it operates to protect the personal privacy of a witness from an 'unwarranted invasion.'9 This letter was *38 properly withheld by the EOUSA pursuant to Exemption 7(C).  The EOUSA asserts that the following documents, which were provided by local law enforcement authorities during the course of a criminal investigation, are not releasable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(D) [hereinafter 'Exemption 7(D)']: a one page internal Fort Lauderdale Police Department document; five pages of letters from the Fort Lauderdale Police Department to third parties regarding authorization for the interception of wire and/or oral communications; and twenty-two pages of three Fort Lauderdale Department Intelligence Reports (one is a duplicate). Under Exemption 7(D) the following materials may not be disclosed:records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such ... information ... (D) could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation ..., information furnished by a confidential source.5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(D) (Supp. I 1990). The Fort Lauderdale Police Department is an agency which compiled the information contained in the twenty-eight pages of documents during a criminal investigation. Therefore, these documents were 'compiled for law enforcement purposes' under Exemption 7(D). Furnishing the documents to plaintiff can reasonably be expected to unveil the identity of and information provided by a confidential source. Disclosure of these documents would dissuade persons from providing information to law enforcement authorities because the sources which provided the information would fear that their identities would not remain confidential. This Court finds that the twenty-eight pages of documents provided in confidence by the Fort Lauderdale Police Department to the USAO were properly withheld by the EOUSA pursuant to Exemption 7(D).  The EOUSA withheld a twelve page grand jury transcript located in the USAO for the Southern District of Florida pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3) [hereinafter 'Exemption (3)']. Carole M. Fernandez, the AUSA who reviewed the withheld grand jury material, has asserted that 'disclosure would impinge upon protected grand jury secrecy.' Declaration of Carole M. Fernandez ['Fernandez Dec.'] (attachment to EOUSA Motion) ¶ 3. Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service ['IRS'] returned the EOUSA's referral package requesting that the EOUSA determine the releasability of four pages of documents which contained grand jury information. After an examination the EOUSA concluded: a one page document was releasable; and, a two page inter-agency memorandum, dated June 11, 1985, from the Deputy Regional Counsel of the IRS to the DOJ's Tax Division and a one page undated IRS memorandum were withheld to protect discussions pertaining to a federal grand jury pursuant to Exemption 3. The EOUSA also maintains that the two page inter-agency memorandum and the one page IRS memorandum can be withheld pursuant to Exemptions 5, 6 and 7(C). Exemption (3) provides; 'This section (§ 552 of the FOIA) does not apply to matters that are—(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute ..., provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.' 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3). The EOUSA maintains that the grand jury transcript is exempt from disclosure pursuant to the general rule of secrecy codified at Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(2). This provision directs that 'any person to whom disclosure is made under paragraph *39 (3)(A)(ii) of this subdivision (government personnel deemed necessary by a government attorney to assist that attorney to enforce federal criminal laws) shall not disclose matters occurring before the grand jury, except as otherwise provided for in these rules.' Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e). The notes of the Advisory Committee reveal: 'This rule continues the traditional practice of secrecy on the part of members of the grand jury, except when the court permits a disclosure (citations omitted).' Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e) (Note to Subdivision (e)) (1990). '[A]ny documents which are generated by the Grand Jury proceedings ..., fall within the protection of Rule 6(e) and should not be released under the FOIA.' Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co. v. SEC, 548 F.Supp. 6, 9 (D.D.C.1982). A petition for disclosure of grand jury material should be 'filed in the district where the grand jury convened' pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e). See Douglas Oil Co. of California v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441 U.S. 211, 225–226, 99 S.Ct. 1667, 1676, 60 L.Ed.2d 156 (1979). Therefore, to obtain these grand jury documents plaintiff must proceed under Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e) in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida. C. Documents Withheld by the BOPCount VII alleges that the BOP did not respond to plaintiff's FOIA/PA requests for information relating to his confinement at the Federal Correctional Institution, in Milan, Michigan. The BOP released several documents in response to plaintiff's request and withheld, either in full or in part, eleven pages pursuant to Exemptions 5 and 7(C); a photocopy of an envelope; memoranda; a letter; and in-transit information.  A single page memorandum was prepared by the Milan prison staff at the direction of the Attorney Advisor, Office of General Counsel. It contained the Milan staff's responses to the lawsuit filed by plaintiff against the BOP. This memorandum was used to formulate the government's response to plaintiff's case against the agency. It was withheld in its entirety as a pre-decisional attorney work-product pursuant to Exemption 5. This document was prepared in contemplation of upcoming litigation. It contains the impressions and opinions of professional staff regarding the projected nature and scope of the agency's response to plaintiff's case. Exemption 5 reflects Congress' desire to withhold an attorney's work product from disclosure to the public. NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., supra, 421 U.S. at 154, 95 S.Ct. at 1518. The professional staff acted as an agent for the Attorney Advisor because it prepared the document to satisfy the attorney's request. The Court finds that the BOP properly withheld this document from disclosure pursuant to Exemption 5.  The information contained within the remaining documents consists of the names of persons who identified plaintiff, personal information, and the location of people who were separated from plaintiff to ensure their mutual safety. These documents were withheld pursuant to Exemption 7(C) which allows an agency to withhold investigative records compiled for law enforcement purposes if disclosing the information could reasonably constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C). A one page photocopy of an envelope which 'contains the name and address of a correspondent of an inmate other than the Plaintiff' was withheld to 'protect the personal privacy and safety of this individual.' Faulkner Dec. ¶ 9(C). Similarly, the identity of various named individuals who, in the judgment of the BOP, should be separated from plaintiff to protect their mutual safety was excised from the following one page documents: 1) a CIM Case Information summary dated September 3, 1987; 2) a letter written by an Assistant U.S. Attorney dated March 31, 1987; 3) memoranda written by BOP staff members dated April 14, 1987, and March 17, 1988; 4) an investigative report issued by a BOP staff member dated July 15, 1988; and 5) in-transit information in documents created by the BOP staff dated July 10, 21, and 24 of 1987. The BOP also asserts that personal information pertaining to an individual named by Drug Enforcement Administration *40 staff was properly excised from a memorandum dated January 12, 1981. All of the documents listed in the preceding paragraph were records 'compiled for law enforcement purposes.' See King v. Department of Justice, supra. Secondly, their production would have the undesirable effect of invading a third party's personal privacy under Exemption 7(C). The Supreme Court takes a liberal view of what constitutes an 'unwarranted invasion of personal privacy' within the meaning of Exemption 7(C).[A] third party's request for law-enforcement records or information about a private citizen can reasonably be expected to invade that citizen's privacy, and that when the request seeks no 'official information' about a Government agency, but merely records what the Government happens to be storing, the invasion of privacy is 'unwarranted.'U.S. Dep't. of Justice v. Reporters Committee, 489 U.S. at ––––, 109 S.Ct. at 1485. Accordingly, the BOP properly withheld these documents pursuant to Exemption 7(C). IV. CONCLUSIONSince the Parole Commission released the entire contents of plaintiff's parole file, summary judgment is entered against plaintiff as to Counts I and VI. The Court also grants summary judgment in favor of the Department of Justice, the Justice Management Division, the USAO for the Eastern District of Missouri and the Southern District of Florida, and the EOUSA on Counts II, III, IV, and V. Plaintiff must proceed under Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e) to obtain the grand jury information withheld by the USAO for the USAO for the Southern District of Florida in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Summary judgment is also granted to the BOP on Count VII.1 The Executive Office of the United States Attorney ['EOUSA'] is handling the FOIA requests made by plaintiff to the USAO for the Southern District of Florida and the Eastern District of Missouri. 2 Defendant Parole Commission tailored its motion as a 'Motion to Dismiss,' however, affidavits and exhibits accompany its motion. Therefore, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), this motion will be treated as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 Motion for Summary Judgment. 3 Plaintiff also filed two Motions for Default Judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 55 against defendant BOP which BOP opposed. Since treatment of the cross-motions for summary judgment is dispositive of this action, the Court does not address plaintiff's two motions for Default Judgment and the opposition thereto. 4 The principal function of the Parole Commission, which is a component of the DOJ, is to enforce criminal laws. Pursuant to general exemptions, the Parole Commission is exempt from the disclosure provisions of the Privacy Act. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(j)(2). Therefore, all disclosure requests for copies of a person's own records submitted to the Parole Commission under the Privacy Act are processed under the FOIA. Declaration of Janice G. McLeod ['McLeod Dec.'] (attachment to the Parole Commission's Motion to Dismiss ['USPC Motion'] ) at ¶ 2. 5 A subsequent request to the Parole Commission from plaintiff seeking 'full disclosure' (less the 967 pages) of all materials compiled in his parole file was not responded to because it involved the same information that had already been released. McLeod Dec. ¶ 19. 6 In her Declaration, Ms. McLeod specifically acknowledges plaintiff's request for his pre-sentence investigation report, McLeod Dec. ¶ 4, but does not detail whether the Parole Commission released a copy of the pre-sentence investigation report to plaintiff. However, the Parole Commission does assert that it released all information responsive to plaintiff's requests without excision. Id. ¶ 20. Furthermore, plaintiff's later requests to the Parole Commission do not concern his pre-sentence investigation report. 7 The FOIA does not require the automatic mailing of updated materials. See Mandel Grunfeld and Herrick v. United States Customs Service, 709 F.2d 41, 43 (11th Cir.1983); Lybarger v. Cardwell, 577 F.2d 764, 767 (1st Cir.1978); see generally, Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 154, 100 S.Ct. 960, 970, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980) ('agencies generally are not obligated to provide extensive services in fulfilling FOIA requests'). 8 As previously discussed, plaintiff was advised that two of these case files could not be located. 9 The record before the Court fails to disclose whether this particular witness testified at trial. In permitting the application of Exemption 7(C), this Court assumes that the requester does not know the identity of the person named in the withheld document."

    "content": "Wednesday: House Judiciary to Markup Contempt Report for AG Bar Washington, D.C.--House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) released the following statement in response to the Department of Justice's (DOJ) letter declining the Committee's counteroffer to view hidden sections of Special Counsel Mueller's report. 'Tonight, in the middle of good faith negotiations with the Attorney General, the Department abruptly announced that it would instead ask President Trump to invoke executive privilege on all of the materials subject to our subpoena. This is, of course, not how executive privilege works. The White House waived these privileges long ago, and the Department seemed open to sharing these materials with us earlier today. The Department's legal arguments are without credibility, merit, or legal or factual basis. 'Worse, this kind of obstruction is dangerous. The Department’s decision reflects President Trump's blanket defiance of Congress’s constitutionally mandated duties. In the coming days, I expect that Congress will have no choice but to confront the behavior of this lawless Administration. The Committee will also take a hard look at the officials who are enabling this cover up. In the meantime, the Committee will proceed with consideration of the contempt citation as planned. I hope that the Department will think better of this last minute outburst and return to negotiations.' The Department of Justice letter to Chairman Nadler asks the Committee to cancel the contempt markup, suspend enforcement of the subpoena and states that they will ask the White House to invoke privilege over the entire report. Background: On April 19, 2019, Chairman Nadler issued a subpoena for the full Mueller report and key underlying evidence. Attorney General Barr had an obligation to provide those materials by May 1. On April 19, 2019, Chairman Nadler and other top Senate and House Democrats sent a letter to Attorney General Barr rejecting his limited offer that would have only allowed twelve Members of Congress to view a less-redacted version of the report in person and would not permit them to discuss it with other Members of Congress who all have top security clearances. On May 1, 2019, the Department missed the subpoena deadline. Attorney General Barr sent a letter to Chairman Nadler instead. On May 2, 2019, Attorney General Barr declined to appear for a scheduled hearing before the House Judiciary Committee. On May 3, 2019, Chairman Nadler wrote to the Attorney General, asking him to make a good faith effort to comply with the subpoena by Monday, May 6, at 9:00 a.m. Nadler requested that the Department reconsider its refusal to allow all Members of Congress and appropriate staff to view redacted portions of the report in a secure location, not including the grand jury material. Nadler asked that the Department work jointly with Congress to seek a court order to provide grand jury material. For the production of underlying documents, Nadler offered to prioritize those materials specifically cited in the report. On May 6, 2019, the Committee noticed a markup of a contempt citation for the Attorney General. The markup is scheduled for Wednesday, May 8, at 10:00 a.m. Later, on May 6, 2019, the Department wrote back to the Committee—proposing a meeting to begin negotiation of “an acceptable accommodation' on access to the full report on Wednesday afternoon. Chairman Nadler has asked for this exact meeting five times over the past six weeks: in letters on March 25, April 1, April 11, April 19, and May 3. During a congressional contempt proceeding, the contempt resolution and report will be debated and voted on by Committee Members. Should the Committee vote to accept the report and hold the Attorney General in contempt, the resolution and report will move to the floor for a full vote in the House to authorize legal proceedings. A copy of the contempt resolution and report is available here. 116th Congress"

    "content": "THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON May 15, 2019 The Honorable Jerrold Nadler Chairman Committee on the Judiciary United States House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Chairman Nadler: I write in response to your letter of March 4, 2019. As I have previously stated, we will work in good faith to accommodate Congress's legitimate requests for info1mation while at the same time respecting the separation of powers and the constitutional prerogatives of the President. Our approach is guided by long-standing precedent and a desire to seek accommodation and cooperation where possible, consistent with mutual respect for the constitutional roles of each branch of government. Since the I 16th Congress convened on January 3, 2019, this Administration has gone to great lengths to respond to congressional infmmation requests. Indeed, in under five months, the Administration has provided hundreds of responses to congressional requests and produced tens of thousands of pages of documents to Congress. Administration officials have testified at congressional hearings well over 100 times, and they have provided hundreds of briefings to congressional committees and individual members of the House and Senate. Your recent assertion that the Administration is acting in 'blanket defiance of Congress's constitutionally mandated duties' is demonstrably false. Statement of Chairman Jerrold Nadler (May 7, 2019). Similarly, your claim that 'virtually all document requests are going unsatisfied' is contradicted by the facts. Statement of Chairman Jerrold Nadler (May 8, 2019). The Administration's significant efforts to accommodate Congress's information requests extend to the House Committee on the Judiciary' s current investigation. As you know, the Special Counsel's Office recently concluded its investigation into the subjects discussed in your March 4 letter. By any measure, the investigation was exhaustive. Indeed, the evidence considered by the Special Counsel's Office was derived from approximately 2,800 subpoenas, 500 executed search warrants, 230 orders for communication records, and 500 witness interviews. Report of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III, Vol. I at 13 (Mar. 2019); Letter from William P. Barr, Attorney General, to Chaitman Lindsey Graham, Chaitman Jerrold Nadler, Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, and Ranking Member Doug Collins 1 (Mar. 24, 2019) (hereinafter Mar. 24, 2019 Barr Letter). Media reports indicate that the Special Counsel's investigation could cost taxpayers 'up to $35 million.' John Haltiwanger, The Mueller investigation could cost up to $35 million once all the expense reports are in, Business Insider (Mar. 25, 2019). On April 18, 2019, the Attorney General went well beyond what is required by law and made the Special Counsel's report available to Congress and the public with minimal redactions. This was an extraordinaiy accommodation in light oflong-standing Department of Justice policies regai·ding the confidentiality of investigations that do not result in prosecution. The report powerfully demonstrates that the Special Counsel found no evidenee that any Americans­ including any member of the President's campaign-conspired or coordinated with Russia to interfere with the 2016 election. The Attorney General and then-Deputy Attorney General also 'concluded that the evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the President eommitted an obstruction-of-justice offense.' Remarks of Attorney General William P. Barr (Apr. 18, 2019); see also Mar. 24, 2019 Barr Letter at 3. In the interest oftransparency, the President did not assert executive privilege over any part of the Speeial Counsel's repmt released on April 18, 2019, even though--as the Attorney General correctly stated--'he would have been well within his rights to do so.' Remarks of Attorney General William P. Barr (Apr. 18, 2019); see also Letter from Emmet T. Flood, Special Counsel to the President, to Williain P. Barr, Attorney General 3-4 (Apr. 19, 2019) (hereinafter Flood Letter) (the President's deeision not to assert executive privilege over any of the presumptively privileged portions of the Special Counsel's report 'is not a waiver of executive privilege for any other material or for any other purpose'). Accordingly, the only redactions in the repo1t were made by the Depaitment of Justice (with the assistance of the Special Counsel's Office and the intelligence community) to protect sensitive information that is safeguarded by law, court orders, orlong-standing Department of Justice policy regarding open investigations. Remarks of Attorney General William P. Barr (Apr. 18, 2019). Moreover, the Attorney General indicated that he would 'make available to a bipartisan group ofleaders from several Congressional committees a version of the report with all redactions removed except those relating to grand-jury information,' which the Department of Justice is prohibited by law from disclosing under Rule6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Id. (explaining that 'these members of Congress will be able to see all of the redacted material for themselves- with the limited exception of that which, by law, cannot be shared'). He also offered to testify voluntai·ily at a public hearing and to answer questions from all members of tbe Committee. You refused even to review the less redacted version of the report before declaring that it was inadequate, ai1d you rejected the Attorney General's offer to testify unless he agreed to unprecedented conditions. Instead, you issued a subpoena to the Attorney General demanding not only the 'complete and unredacted report,' but also '[a]ll documents referenced in the Report' and '[a]ll documents obtained and investigation materials created by the Special Counsel's Office.' Subpoena to William P. Barr, Attorney General (Apr. 18, 2019). Thus, the subpoena's plain language covers grand-jmy information that the Committee knows the Attorney General cannot provide without violating the law. See id Even though the Committee had rebuffed a good faith offer to accommodate Congress's interests by disclosing the entire report--except for grand-jury information--to congressional leadership, the Department of Justice proposed further accommodations, including ofiers 'to expand the number of staff members who may review the minimally redacted report; to allow Members of Congress who have reviewed the minimally redacted report to discuss the material freely among themselves; and to allow Members to take and retain their notes following their review.' Letter from Stephen E. Boyd, Assistant Attorney General, to Chairman Jerrold Nadler 1 (May 7, 2019). The Committee summarily rejected these additional accommodations, abruptly terminated ongoing negotiations, and prematurely voted to recommend that the Attorney General be held in contempt of Congress--a mere 19 days after the Committee served its subpoena on the Attorney General. Id; Letter from Stephen E. Boyd, Assistant Attorney General, to Chairman Jerrold Nadler 1 (May 8, 2019). In other words, the Committee rushed to vote on contempt for failing to provide 100% and immediate compliance with a subpoena that seeks millions ofpages of documents from a prosecutor's files. Moreover, the Committee--for the first time in American history--has voted to recommend that the Attorney General be held in contempt because he refused to violate the law by turning over grand-jury materials that he may not lawfully disclose. The Committee took these drastic actions in under three weeks without making any reasonable attempt to engage in the constitutionally mandated accommodation process to narrow its requests. Lost in the Committee's legally indefensible rush to recommend a contempt citation is the reality that the Committee has not articulated any proper legislative purpose for pursuing inquiries that duplicate matters that were the subject of the Special Counsel's inquiry. Congressional investigations are intended to obtain infmmation to aid in evaluating potential legislation, not to harass political opponents or to pursue an unauthorized 'do-over' of exhaustive law enforcement investigations conducted by the Department of Justice. Under the circumstances, the appropriate course is for the Committee to discontinue the inquiry discussed in the March 4 letter. Unfortunately, it appears that you have already decided to press ahead with a duplicative investigation, including by issuing subpoenas, to replow the same ground the Special Counsel has already covered. I ask that you reconsider that approach. With the Special Counsel's investigation behind us, the President and his team stand ready to work with the Committee cooperatively to advance a legislative agenda for the benefit of the American people. If the Committee continues to pursue its inquiry, the requests in the Committee's March 4 letter suffer from numerous legal defects and reflect little, if any, respect for the legitimate interests of the Executive Branch or for the accommodation process that governs congressional requests for information from the Executive. The Executive Branch interests at stake are not new and have been uniformly recognized and respected by the President's predecessors--from President Washington to President Obama. The principal legal flaws in the Committee's requests are summarized here and discussed in greater detail below. First, the letter implicates all four components of executive privilege, seeking core Executive Branch communications that are not subject to disclosure under settled legal principles. This includes (i) confidential communications between the President and his advisors; (ii) confidential deliberations among Executive Branch officials; (iii) information relating to law enforcement investigations; and (iv) confidential communications between the President and foreign leaders. The President's decision to cooperate with the Special Counsel's investigation and not to assert executive privilege over any of the presumptively privileged portions of the Special Counsel's report, as released on April 18, 2019, 'is not a waiver of executive privilege for any other material or for any other purpose.' Flood Letter at 3-4. Second, the letter requests information about functions that the Constitution assigns exclusively to the Executive, which are traditionally deemed beyond the reach of congressional oversight. Third, it appears that the Committee's inquiry is designed, not to further a legitimate legislative purpose, but rather to conduct a pseudo law enforcement investigation on matters that were already the subject of the Special Counsel's long-running investigation and are outside the constitutional authority of the legislative branch. The only purpose for this duplication seems to be harassing and seeking to embarrass political opponents after an exhaustive two-year investigation by the Department of Justice did not reach the conclusion that some members of the Committee apparently would have preferred. That, of course, is not a permissible purpose for demanding confidential information from the Executive. Finally, when the requests are evaluated in light of these cumulative defects showing no regard for the legitimate interests of the Executive Branch--combined with the sweeping scope of the requests--it becomes apparent that they bear no relation to any articulated goal of legitimate congressional oversight. Instead, they amount to little more than an unprecedented effort to interfer with the President's ability to perform his constitutional duties. As a result, the requests raise serious concerns of violating the separation fo powers enshrined in the Constitution. As I have repeatedly made clear, we respect the authority of Congress to make legitimate requests for information to aid it in the task of legislating and will work with the Committee through the constitutionally mandated accommodation process to provide the Committee with information it can properly seek. It would greatly advance the first step in that process if the Committee were to narrow the sweeping scope of the requests in the letter and articulate the legislative pu1pose and legal support for each of the disparate requests it wishes to pursue, including by addressing each of the legal deficiencies that I raise in this letter. Finally, I reiterate my concern that the Committee has sent letters directly to current and former White House officials, including several individuals who served in the Office of the White House Counsel. As I have consistently emphasized in my correspondence with other committees, any contact with current or fonner White House officials should be through the Office ofthe White House Counsel, so that we may ensure appropriate accommodation of the Committee's informational needs while protecting the important constitutional interests of the Executive. Asa matter of basic courtesy and respect for a co-equal branch of our government, I request that you direct your staff to work through my office to request information from current or former White House officials. Prior administrations have made the smne request. See, e.g., Letter from Kathryn H. Ruemmler, Counsel to President Obama, to Chailman Fred Upton, Chairman Cliff Stearns, Chailman Joseph R. Pitts, and Vice Chairman Michael C. Burgess, M.D. (Nov. 14, 2011) ('[A]ny requests from Committee or Committee staffto speak witl1 current or fmmer White House officials about their official responsibilities at the White House should be directed to the Office ofthe White House Counsel.'). Consulting with my office will ensure that the Committee efficiently obtains access to the information and individuals to which it is entitled and that any disclosure ofprivileged information to Congress is properly authorized. I. The Committee's Requests Unreasonably Target Matters at the Core of Well-Settled Executive Branch Confidentiality Interests. It has long been recognized that robust confidentiality protections are essential for the proper functioning of the Executive Branch. Those protections are firmly rooted in the Constitution and can be overcome by Congress, ifat all, only in limited circumstances. See Senate Select Comm. on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, 498 F.2d 725, 731 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (en bane) (requiring a showing that confidential Executive Branch documents are 'demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment ofthe Committee's functions'). The importance ofdefending this constitutionally based protection for the Executive Branch has been consistently recognized by administrations of both political parties. For example, in response to congressional requests for documents, the Obama Administration strenuously argued that, '[a]s courts have long recognized, the Executive Branch's role in enforcing the law requires that some materials remain confidential so that the Executive's proper functioning under the Constitution is preserved and protected.' Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. 14, Comm. on Oversight & Gov't Reform v. Holder, No. 12-cv-1332, 2014 WL 12662665 (D.D.C. Aug. 20, 2014); see also Letter from W. Neil Eggleston, Counsel to President Obama, to Chainnan Darrell E. Issa (July 15, 2014) (highlighting the need to 'preserv[e] the President's independence and autonomy, as well as his ability to obtain candid advice and counsel to aid him in the discharge of his constitutional duties'). As the Obama Administration rightly explained--contrary to the assertions in your March 4 letter-even 'a claim of 'misconduct' does not invalidate' these protections. Mem. in Supp. ofDef.'s Mot. for Summ. J. 36, Comm. on Oversight & Gov't Reform, 2014 WL 12662665; see also Senate Select Comm., 498 F.2d at 732-33. These rnles apply regardless of who occupies the Oval Office or controls the majority in the House or Senate. Despite bipartisan recognition of the Executive Branch's need to maintain confidentiality with regard to certain kinds ofcommunications, the Committee's requests target four categories of Executive Branch infonnation that are plainly protected from disclosure to Congress. I address each category in turn here and request that the Committee clarify what info1mation it is actually seeking and the justification for pursuing such information. A clear statement of the Committee's needs will enable us to explore developing an appropriate accommodation. First, many of the requests in the letter expressly seek documents involving communications between the President and his most senior advisors. For instance, Request 1(a) seeks communications between the President and the Counsel to the President; Request 1(d) seeks communications involving the President, Vice President, White House Chief of Staff, and other senior advisors to the President; and Request 1(l) seeks communications between the President and the Acting Attorney General. The President has a constitutionally grounded interest in being able to consult with his advisors in a confidential manner. See Immunity ofthe Assistant to the President and Director ofthe Office of Political Strategy and Outreach From Congressional Subpoena, 38 Op. O.L.C. _, at *6 (July 15, 2014) ('[S]ubjecting an immediate presidential adviser to Congress's subpoena power would threaten the President's autonomy and his ability to receive sound and candid advice.'); Letter from W. Neil Eggleston, Counsel to President Obama, to Chairman Jason Chaffetz (May 16, 2016) (noting the importance of the President's 'ability to receive candid advice and counsel in the discharge of his constitutional duties.'). The courts have limited Congress's ability to seek disclosure of presidential communications, and for good reason. Infmmed decisionmaking requires the candid exchange of ideas, and '[h]uman experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process.' United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 705 (1974). As a result, the Supreme Court has long recognized the Executive's interest in the confidentiality of decisionmaking as a central component of the constitutional separation of powers: A President and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately. . . . The [presidential communications] privilege is fuudamental to the operation of Government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution. Id. at 708. Accordingly, we ask that the Committee articulate the legislative purpose that justifies the Committee's extraordinary requests seeking disclosure of presidential communications. Second, the Committee requests documents exposing internal predecisional deliberations. For example, numerous requests seek documents reflecting internal discussions concerning the development of public statements, Executive Branch personnel decisions, and the exercise of various Executive powers. See Letter Schedule A. But congressional needs generally do not override the Executive Branch's confidentiality interests with respect to documents that are predecisional and deliberative, even if they do not involve communications with the President. Protections ensuring that the deliberative process can remain confidential apply to the entire Executive Branch and cover documents that reflect 'advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated'--precisely the types of documents requested by the Committee. In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 737 (D.C. Cir. 1997). This position has been consistently recognized by administrations of both political parties. See Assertion of Executive Privilege Over Documents Generated in Response to Congressional Investigation into Operation Fast and Furious, 36 Op. O.L.C. _, at *3 (June 19, 2012) ('The threat of compelled disclosure of confidential Executive Branch deliberative material can discourage robust and candid deliberations ....'); Assertion of Executive Privilege Over Communications Regarding EPA 's Ozone Air Quality Standards and California's Greenhouse Gas Waiver Request, 32 Op. O.L.C. I, 2 (2008) ('Documents generated for the purpose of assisting the President in making a decision are protected' and these protections also 'encompass[] Executive Branch deliberative communications that do not implicate presidential decisionmaking'); Assertion ofExecutive Privilege Regarding White House Counsel's Office Documents, 20 Op. O.L.C. 2, 3 (1996) ('The Supreme Court has expressly (and unanimously) recognized that the Constitution gives the President the power to protect the confidentiality of White House communications.'). Third, the Executive Branch has a compelling interest in protecting materials associated with law enforcement investigations. The Committee's requests acknowledge the existence of related law enforcement investigations and expressly seek 'documents [the White House] furnished' as pmi of those investigations. See Letter Document Requests. It is well settled that the Executive Branch has authority to withhold from Congress documents from law enforcement files in order 'to preserve the integrity and independence of criminal investigations and prosecutions'--including 'documents related to a closed criminal investigation.' Assertion of Executive Privilege Concerning the Special Counsel's Interviews ofthe Vice President and Senior White House Staff, 32 Op. O.L.C. 7, 10 (2008). The Committee has no legitimate role in collecting law enforcement materials with the aim of simply duplicating a law enforcement inquiry because it does not like either (i) the conclusions reached by the Depatirnent of Justice or (ii) the confidential nature of the investigation, which limits the Committee's ability to access infmmation that is protected from disclosure under existing law. Pe1mitting congressional committees to demand the duplication of information in law enforcement files every time a high-profile and politically charged investigation was underway would irredeemably undem1ine the integrity and independence of actual law enforcement investigations. See id. Mere 'exposure' is not a legitimate use of congressional investigative authority. Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 200 (1957)('We have no doubt that there is no congressional power to expose for the sake of exposure.'). In addition, even after an investigation is completed, congressional access to investigative files raises both 'a general concern about the prospect of committees of Congress obtaining confidential records from Justice Department criminal investigative files for the purpose of addressing highly politicized issues in public committee hearings' and, in the current context, a '[m]ore specific[] ... concern[]' that access would 'significantly impair the Department's ability to conduct future law enforcement investigations that would benefit from full White House cooperation.' Special Counsel's Interviews of the Vice President and Senior White House Staff, 32 Op. O.L.C. at 10-11. The Committee's demand for materials associated with law enforcement investigations is pmiicularly unwarranted here, where the Committee already has access to the Special Counsel's report, as released on April 18, 2019. Any additional materials are thus not 'demonstrably critical' to the Committee's work. Senate Select Comm., 498 F.2d at 731. Fourth, the Committee is seeking documents concerning communications between the President and a foreign leader. See Request 4(k). As I recently explained in response to similar requests from other House committees, it is settled law that the Constitution entrusts the conduct offoreign relations exclusively to the Executive Branch, as it makes the President 'the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.' United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936); see also Chicago & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 109 (1948) ('The President also possesses in his own right ce1iain powers conferred by the Constitution on him as ... the Nation's organ in foreign affairs.'); Letter from Pat A. Cipollone, Counsel to the President, to Chahman Elijah E. Cunnnings, Chairmat1 Eliot Engel, and Chairman Admn B. Schiff (Mar. 21, 2019) (smne). In keeping with Supreme Comi precedent, the Executive Brat1ch has consistently taken the position, across administrations of both political parties, that the President has exclusive authority to conduct diplomacy with foreign nations. See, e.g., Assertion of Executive Privilege for Documents Concerning Conduct of Foreign Affairs with Respect to Haiti, 20 Op. O.L.C. 5, 7 (1996) ('[T]he conduct of foreign affairs is an exclusive prerogative of the executive branch.'); Bill to Relocate United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, 19 Op. O.L.C. 123, 124 (1995) ('It is well settled that the Constitution vests the President with the exclusive authority to conduct the Nation's diplomatic relations with other States.'); Common Legislative Encroachments on Executive Branch Authority, 13 Op. O.L.C. 248, 256 (1989) ('The President has the respnosibility, under the Constitution, to determine the form and manner in which the United States will maintain relations with foreign nations.'). The President must be free to engage in discussions with foreign leaders without fear that those communications will be disclosed and used as fodder for pattisan political purposes. And foreign leaders must be assured of this as well. No foreign leader would engage in private conversations with the President, or the President's senior advisors, if such conversations were subject to public disclosure (or disclosure to committees of Congress). Indeed,PresidentGeorge Washington made this point when he declined a House committee's request for copies of documents relating to the negotiation ofthe Jay Treaty with Great Britain. See History of Refusals by Executive Branch Officials to Provide Information Demanded by Congress, 6 Op. O.L.C.751, 753 (1982) (noting that President Washington sent a letter to Congress stating, '[t]o admit, then, a right in the House of Representatives to demand,and to have, as a matter of course, all the papers respecting a negotiation with a foreign Power, would be to establish a dangerous precedent'). This Administration intends to adhere to the same confidentiality principles that have governed American diplomacy for well over 200 years. II. The Committee Has No Authority to Inquire into the President's Discharge of Duties Assigned Exclusively to the Executive by the Constitution. The Committee's requests repeatedly run afoul of the Constitution by encroaching upon authorities that the Constitution assigns exclusively to the Executive Branch. These requests have no legitimate legislative purpose and exceed Congress's limited authority. The Supreme Comt explained decades ago that '[s]ince Congress may only investigate into those areas in which it may potentially legislate or appropriate, it cannot inquire into matters which are within the exclusive province of one of the other branches of the Government.' Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109, 111-12 (1959). For exat11ple, the Committee has announced its intention to investigate 'the pardon power.' See March 4, 2019 Press Release. But the pardon power is exclusively in the province of the Executive. The power 'flows from the Constitution alone, not from any legislative enactments, and ...it caunot be modified, abridged, or diminished by the Congress.' Schick v. Reed, 419 U.S. 256, 266 (1974); see also Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. 333, 380 (1866) ('This power of the President is not subject to legislative control. Congress can neither limit the effect of his pardon, nor exclude from its exercise any class of offenders. The benign prerogative of mercy reposed in him cannot be fettered by any legislative restrictions.'). Thus, Congress's oversight authority does not extend to the President's pardon power. See Assertion ofExecutive Privilege With Respect to Clemency Decision, 23 Op. O.L.C. 1, 3-4 (1999) ('[I]t appears that Congress' oversight authority does not extend to the process employed in connection with a particular clemency decision, to the materials generated or the discussions that took place as patt of that process, or to the advice or views the President received in connection with a clemency decision.'). Similarly, the Committee's plan to 'investigate' 'other presidential authorities,' see March 4, 2019 Press Release, plainly crosses the line to inquire into functions exclusively assigned to the President, including communications between the President and foreign leaders (e.g., Request 4(k)) and presidential personnel decisions (e.g., Requests 1(b), 1(d), 1(e), 1(f), 1(h)). See Curtiss­ Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. at 320 ('[T]he President [is] the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations-a power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of Congress.'); Ass'n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Clinton, 997 F.2d 898, 909 (D.C. Cir. 1993) ('Article II ... gives [the President] the flexibility to organize his advisors and seek advice from them as he wishes.'). Because Congress lacks authority in these areas of exclusive presidential authority, there is no legitimate legislative purpose for the Committee's information requests. See Barenblatt, 360 U.S. at 111-12. III. The Committee's Efforts to Conduct a Law Enforcement Investigation for the Purpose of Embarrassing, Harassing, or Punishing Political Opponents are Improper. As presently framed, the Committee's inquiries transparently amount to little more than an attempt to duplicate--and supplant--law enforcement inquiries, and apparently to do so simply because the actual law enforcement investigations conducted by the Department ofJustice did not reach a conclusion favored by some members ofthe Committee. That is not a proper legislative purpose. As you know, the Conunittee is not a law enforcement agency. Thus, the Committee cannot justify its inquiry simply by asserting that it is searching for possible evidence of its false claims of 'obstruction of justice' or--more vaguely--that it is launching an investigation into nonexistent purported 'threats against the rule oflaw.' See March 4, 2019 Press Release. Pursuing investigations into alleged violations of the criminal code is indisputably a 'function[] of the executive and judicial departments of government.' Watkins, 354 U.S. at 187 (explaining that Congress is not 'a law enforcement or trial agency'); see also Quinn v. United States, 349 U.S. 155, 161 (1955) (Congress's 'power to investigate must not be confused with any ofthe powers of law enforcement; those powers are assigned under our Constitution to the Executive and the Judiciary'). The Department of Justice--not the Committee on the Judiciary--is the appropriate authority to conduct law enforcement investigations. Nor can the Committee justify its requests simply by asserting that it intends to expose for the sake of exposure. See Letter at 1 (pledging to 'present our findings to the American people, whatever those findings may be'). The Supreme Comt long ago made clear that congressional investigations premised on that purported authority are an abuse of power because 'there is no congressional power to expose for the sake of exposure,' and there is no 'general power to expose where the predominant result can only be an invasion of the private rights of individuals.' Watkins, 354 U.S. at 200; see also Quinn, 349 U.S. at 161 (congressional investigations 'cannot be used to inquire into private affairs unrelated to a valid legislative purpose'). As then-Attorney General Eric Holder explained during the Obama Administration, 'Congress's legislative function does not imply a freestanding authority to gather information for the sole purpose of informing 'the American people.'' Congressional Investigation into Operation Fast and Furious, 36O Op. O.L.C. _, at *7 (internal quotation marks omitted). To the contrary, the 'only infmming function' of Congress 'is that of informing itself about subjects susceptible to legislation, not that of informing the public.' Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, it is well settled that '[i]nvestigatios conducted solely for the personal aggrandizement of the investigators or to 'punish' those investigated are indefensible.' Watkins, 354 U.S. at 187. Instead, the Committee's inquiries must be tied to a valid legislative purpose--that is, they must be tied to evaluating or formulating potential legislation on some subject within the Committee's authority. As then-Attorney General Holder explained in articulating the Obama Administration's position, congressional information requests 'must be in furtherance of Congress's legitimate legislative responsibilities' because '[c]ongressional oversight of Executive Branch actions is justifiable only as a means of facilitating the legislative task of enacting, amending, or repealing laws.' Congressional Investigation into Operation Fast and Furious, 36 Op. O.L.C. _, at *5 (alteration and emphasis in original). And it is critical to the constitutionally mandated accommodation process that the Committee articulate its legislative purpose. Only with that purpose in mind can this office evaluate in good faith the Committee's need for information, formulate potential accommodations to address the Committee's need for information, and evaluate, in light of the Executive's constitutionally based interests in preserving confidentiality, what information is 'demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment of the Committee's functions.' Senate Select Comm., 498 F.2d at 731. In addition, even if the Committee were to attempt to articulate a legitimate legislative purpose for some of its inquiries, the authority of congressional committees to explore in detail any particular case of alleged wrongdoing is limited. In restricting the scope of legitimate congressional oversight, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has explained that 'legislative judgments nmmally depend more on the predicted consequences of proposed legislative actions and their political acceptability, than on precise reconstrnction of past events.' Id. at 732. To the extent the Committee's current press statements and list of inquiries suggest a probe akin to that undertaken by the Executive Branch, I respectfully submit that they reflect a misunderstanding of the Committee's legitimate functions. Under settled law, it is not the Committee's legislative function to conduct a detailed inquiry into a particular event or series of events in order to reconstrnct a precise picture of the facts. Id. Thus, demands for such detail will rarely be 'demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment of the Committee's functions.' See id. at 731. I also find it particularly disturbing that the Committee is not only improperly setting out to duplicate law enforcement investigations when some Committee members disagree with the conclusions of these investigations without articulating any properly defined legislative purpose, but it is doing so having already announced a predetermined conclusion. See, e.g., Interview with Chaiiman Jerrold Nadler, ABC's 'This Week' (Mar. 3, 2019). In contrast, the Department of Justice reached its conclusions after the Special Counsel exhaustively conducted an investigation for nearly two years. The Attorney General, who previously served as Attorney General and is one of the nation's most respected lawyers, and the then-Deputy Attorney General, a career public servant who has spent nearly thirty years as a federal prosecutor, reviewed the Special Counsel's report and made decisions based on the evidence, Department of Justice guidelines, and their collective experience. See Remarks of Attorney General William P. Barr (Apr. 18, 2019); Mar. 24, 2019 Barr Letter 1, 3. The White House will not participate in the Committee's 'investigation' that brushes aside the conclusions of the Department of Justice after a two-year-long effort in favor of political theater pre-ordained to reach a preconceived and false result. IV. The Committee's Sweeping Document Requests, Unmoored from Any Properly Defined Legislative Purpose, Violate the Separation of Powers. Overall, the March 4 letter must be understood in light of the cumulative effect of the numerous defects outlined above. Viewed in that light, the sweeping requests spelled out in the letter in their current form run afoul of the constitutional principle that a co-equal branch of government cannot abuse its role under the Constitution by undertaking actions that amount to 'an unwarranted impairment of another branch in the performance of its constitutional duties.' Cheney v. United States Dist. Court for the Dist. of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 390 (2004); see also Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 757 (1996) ('Even when a branch does not arrogate power to itself, ... the separation-of-powers doctrine requires that a branch not impair another branch in the performance of its constitutional duties.'); Scope of Congressional Oversight and Investigative Power With Respect to the Executive Branch, 9 Op. O.L.C. 60, 62 (1985) (' Congress' power of inquiry must not be permitted to negate the President's constitutional responsibility for managing and controlling affairs committed to the Executive Branch.'). The Supreme Court has applied this broad separation of powers principle to document requests that affect the functioning ofthe Executive. In Cheney, plaintiffs in civil litigation served overly broad discovery requests on a presidential task force chaired by the Vice President. 542 U.S.at 372, 387. The Court held that the defendants were not required to undertake the burden associated with responding to such requests before the requests were properly limited based on separation-of-powers concerns. Id. at 388. In reaching its conclusion,the Court noted that 'special considerations control when the Executive Branch's interests in maintaining the autonomy of its office and safeguarding the confidentiality of its communications are implicated.' Id. at 385. The Court further noted that '[t]he high respect that is owed to the office of the Chief Execntive . . . is a matter that should inform the conduct of the entire proceeding, including the timing and scope of discovery,' and that 'the Executive's constitutional responsibilities and status [are] factors counseling judicial deference and restraint in the conduct oflitigation against it.' Id. (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Accordingly, the Conrt remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to determine whether the discovery orders were improper because they constituted an 'unwarranted impairment' of the Executive Branch. Id. at 390, 392. Under the principle applied in Cheney, the Committee's sweeping document requests violate the separation of powers. The nearly thirty document requests in the letter (some with multiple subpaiis) are not only incredibly vohnninous, but also breathtaking in scope, covering a sweeping array of events, communications, topics, time periods, and individuals. The Committee's requests do not come close to reflecting restraint in volume and scope, as required under Cheney--particularly when those requests are directed at the President. As outlined above, the requests repeatedly and directly target documents at the core of each of the four recognized components of executive privilege. Based on the sheer number and scope of the Committee's requests, it is clear that the Committee is trying to unduly burden the Office of the President so as to impair the President's ability to carry out his constitutional duties. The Constitution does not permit Congress to undermine the President in this manner. As the Supreme Court has recognized, '[t]he power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process,' but this 'power of inquiry . . . is not unlimited.' Watkins, 354 U.S. at 187. Indeed, '[n]o inquiry is an end in itself; it must be related to, and in furtherance of, a legitimate task of the Congress.' Id. We respect Congress and its authority to seek information to aid it in considering legislation, and we stand ready to work to accommodate all congressional committees that have a legitimate legislative interest in seeking information. We do not believe the investigation discussed in the March 4 letter is a legitimate exercise of oversight authority; patiicularly now that the Special Counsel's Office of the Department of Justice has completed its work. As discussed, it seeks information that directly implicates core separation of powers and Executive Branch confidentiality interests. Our responsibility to the constitutionally based prerogatives of the Executive Branch, our obligation to protect those prerogatives for all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, and our respect for the rule oflaw require that we resist the overbroad demands in the Committee's letter. As I have said numerous times, my office will work with the Committee through the constitutionally mandated accommodation process to provide the Committee with materials it can properly request. If the Committee intends to continue its inquiry, it would greatly advance that process if the Committee were to narrow the scope of the requests in the March 4 letter and articulate the legislative purpose and legal basis supporting each of the remaining requests. Thank you for your attention to the important issues discussed above. I welcome the opportunity to discuss any of these points. Sincerely, Pat A. Cipollone Pat A. Cipollone Counsel to the President cc: The Honorable Doug Collins, Ranking Member"

    "content": "DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY WASHINGTON, D.C. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY May 17, 2019 The Honorable Richard E. Neal Chairman Committee on Ways and Means U.S. House of Representatives Washington, DC 20515 Dear Chairman Neal I write in response to your letter of May 10, 2019, in which you reiterate your request for the confidential tax returns (and other information) of President Trump and related business entities, and in which you include a subpoena for the documents you have requested. As I explained in my May 6 letter to the Committee, the Department of the Treasury (the Department) has consulted with the Department of Justice concerning the lawfulness of the Committee's unprecedented request. In reliance on the advice of the Department of Justice, we have determined that the Committee's request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose, and pursuant to section 6103, the Department is therefore not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information. For the same reasons, we are unable to provide the requested information in response to the Committee's subpoena. As I explained in my May 6 letter, the Department of Justice has informed us that it intends to memorialize its advice in a published legal opinion as soon as practicable. In my April 23 letter to the Committee, I offered to work with the Committee to accommodate its stated interest in understanding how the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a President by providing the Committee with additional information on the mandatory audit process. I renewed that offer in my May 6 letter. While the Committee's latest letter appears to decline these offers because they are 'not a substitute' for the President's tax returns, the Department's offer would provide information that directly bear upon what the Committee has stated to be its legislative interest in this subject. Consistent with the Executive Branch's constitutional commitment to accommodation, the Department remains committed to providing such an accommodation. Sincerely, Steven T. Mnuchin Steven T. Mnuchin"
