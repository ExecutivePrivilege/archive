  <h1>SPECIAL REPORT: Impeachment Inquiry of President Donald J. Trump</h1>
  <div>
    <p>On October 8, 2019, White House Counsel Pat A. Cipollone wrote a letter informing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform Committees,</p>
    <blockquote>"President Trump and his Administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process. Your unprecedented actions have left the President with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances."</blockquote>
