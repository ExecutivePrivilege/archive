THE WHITE HOUSE. Washington March 9, 1948 My Dear Mr. Congressman: I am returning to you herewith two subpenas recently issued to me on behalf of your subcommittee. On Saturday, March 6, I received a subpena calling for my attendance at a hearing to be held that afternoon. On Monday, March 8, I received another subpena calling for my attendance at a hearing to be held the same day. As you know, my official duties are to advise and assist the President of the United States. After the receipt of each of these subpenas, I promptly informed the President, and in each instance the President directed me in view of my duties as his assistant, not to appear before your subcommittee. Sincerely yours, John R. Steelman The Assistant to the President
