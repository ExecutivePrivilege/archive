U.S. Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations, March 1, 1972. Mr. Frank Shakespeare: I am enclosing a copy of Mr. Ablad's letter of February 28 to Mr. Robert Dockery of the Committee staff concerning the status of the Country Program Memoranda prepared by the United States Information Agency. I understand from Mr. Ablard's letter that the Memoranda are regarded as 'internal planning or working documents' and as such, the Agency believes that “it would not be appropriate to provide these documents to the Committee.' As you know, the “Agency in Brief 1972' publication describes this material in the following way: 'These CPM's (Country Program Memoranda) are designed to integrate USIS planning and resource allocation with overall U.S. objectives in the country. The CPM's encompass total Agency resources devoted to the country, including media products and materials supplied from Washington.' (p. 19) I believe this information would be of interest to all Members of the Committee and of particular assistance to them in connection with the Agency's authorization hearings, beginning March 20. In view of this, I am requesting that the Agency recon- sider its decision and agree to make this information available to the Committee. I should appreciate hearing from you on this matter at your earliest convenience and, hopefully, no later than March 10. If the original decision is maintained, I should like to know what the Agency's legal authority is for withholding this type of information from the Congress. Sincerely yours, J. W. Fulbright, Chairman.
