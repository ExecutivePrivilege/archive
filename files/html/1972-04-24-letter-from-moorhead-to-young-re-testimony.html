    <p>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND GOVERNMENT INFORMATION SUBCOMMITTEE, COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS,<br><i>Washington, D.C. April 24, 1972.</i></p>
    <p>Mr. DAVID YOUNG,<br><i>Special Assistant to the National Security Council,</i><br><i>The White House, Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>Dear Mr. Young: Early next month, the Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee will begin our review of security classification problems affecting exemption (b) (1) of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).</p>
    <p>As part of these hearings, we will examine the way in which the President's new Executive Order 11652 will affect the economic and efficient operation of our security classification system, the rationale behind its various pro- visions, and alternatives to the present approach.</p>
    <p>We would very much like to have you as a witness from the executive branch because of your key role in developing the new system. Of course, we are aware of the usual reluctance of Executive Office officials to testify before congressional committees and would therefore agree in advance not to pose questions that might tend to impinge on your personal discussions with the President in this area.</p>
    <p>In view of the vital importance of your testimony to the subject of our hearings, we would hope that a waiver along the lines of that recently granted in the case of Mr. Peter Flanigan could be obtained to make it possible for you to appear before our subcommittee on Tuesday, May 2, at 10 a.m. in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building.</p>
    <p>We look forward to a favorable response because we know that you could make a positive and significant contribution to the subcommittee's inquiry into this most important subject.</p>
    <p>With best regards,<br>Sincerely,<br>WILLIAM S. MOORHEAD,<br><i>Chairman.</i></p>
