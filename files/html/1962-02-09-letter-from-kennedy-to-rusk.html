    <p>THE WHITE HOUSE,<br><i>Washington, February 9, 1962.</i></p>
    <p>The Honorable the SECRETARY OF STATE,<br><i>Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary: I am attaching directed him, and all personnel under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, not to give any testimony or produce any documents which would enable the Senate's Special Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee to identify and hold accountable any individual with respect to any particular speech that he has reviewed.</p>
    <p>That letter states that I am issuing parallel instructions to the Secretary of State. I therefore direct you, and all personnel under the jurisidiction of your Department, not to give any such testimony or produce any such documents.</p>
    <p>As I noted in my letter to Secretary McNamara, the principle of Executive privilege cannot be automatically applied to every request for information. Each case must be judged on its own merits. But the principle as applied to these facts governs the personnel of your Department equally with that of the Department of Defense. In neither case do I intend to permit subordinate officials of the career services to bear the brunt of congressional inquiry into policies which are the responsibilities of their superiors.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>JOHN F. KENNEDY</p>
    <p>Enclosure.</p>
