    <p>U.S. SENATE,<br>COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS,<br><i>December 29, 1972.</i></p>
    <p>Hon. HENRY A. KISSINGER,<br><i>Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs,</i><br><i>The White House, Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>Dear Dr. Kissinger: I have scheduled a meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee in Executive Session for 2:30 Tuesday afternoon, January 2 in room Sâ€”116 of the Capitol to consider the situation in Vietnam and to discuss future activities of the Committee.</p>
    <p>I hope very much that you can be with us at that time to brief the Committee, with particular reference to the status of peace negotiations, and to give us the benefit of your views. I am extending a similar invitation to Secretary Rogers.</p>
    <p>Sincerely yours,<br>J. W. FULBRIGHT,<br><i>Chairman.</i></p>
