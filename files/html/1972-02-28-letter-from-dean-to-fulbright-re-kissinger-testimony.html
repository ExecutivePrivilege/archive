    <p>THE WHITE HOUSE,<br><i>Washington, D.C., February 28, 1972.</i></p>
    <p>Hon. J. W. FULBRIGHT,<br><i>Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This will acknowledge receipt and thank you for your letter to Dr. Henry A. Kissinger dated <a href="/archive/files/html/1972-02-10-letter-from-fulbright-to-kissinger.html">February 10, 1972</a>, which in his absence has been referred to me for response.</p>
    <p>Consistent with long established principle and precedent, because of Dr. Kissinger’s position as a member of the President’s immediate staff he will be unable to accept your gracious invitation to appear before the Committee on Foreign Relations.</p>
    <p>However, please be assured that we share your belief that the Executive and Legislative Branches should exchange views on foreign policy, and we are confident that such exchange can be carried out to the fullest extent by the constituted officers of the Executive Branch.</p>
    <p>With warm regards.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>JOHN W. DEAN III,<br><i>Counsel to the President.</i></p>
