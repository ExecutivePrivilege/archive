    <p>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SUBCOMMITTEE ON FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND GOVERNMENT INFORMATION,<br>COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS,<br><i>Washington, D.C., June 21,1971.</i></p>
    <p>Hon. HENRY A. KISSINGER,<br><i>Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>DEAR MR. KISSINGER: The Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee has scheduled a series of hearings to begin Wednesday, June 23, 1971, on U.S. Government information policies and practices.</p>
    <p>Pursuant to the Subcommittee's legislative and investigative authority over Government information subjects, we will explore the Constitutional principles and operational practices involved in the public's "right to know" and the right of the Legislative Branch to information and documents from the Executive Branch that are deemed essential in the discharge of our duties as elected representatives of the American people.</p>
    <p>You are hereby requested to appear before the Subcommittee as a witness at 10:00 a.m., Wednesday, June 30, 1971, in Room 2247, Rayburn House Office Building.</p>
    <p>In addition to your general views and comments on the subjects included within the scope of our inquiry, please be prepared to discuss procedures and practices concerning the coordination of Executive implementation of the provisions of Executive Order 10501 (18 F.R. 7049) and Executive Order 10964 (26 F.R. 8932), relating to "Safeguarding Official Information in the Interests of the Defense of the United States," and the automatic downgrading and declassification procedures for documents, information, and other security material presently in effect.</p>
    <p>With best regards,<br>Sincerely,<br>WILLIAM S. MOORHEAD,<br><i>Chairman.</i></p>
