    <p>THE WHITE HOUSE,<br><i>Washington, January 16, 1973.</i></p>
    <p>Hon. J. W. FULBRIGHT,<br><i>Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,</i><br><i>U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is to acknowledge your <a href="/archive/files/html/1972-12-29-letter-from-fulbright-to-kissinger.html">letter of December 29</a>, which has been referred to me for reply. As I am sure you are aware, by long-standing precedent and practice members of the President’s immediate staff do not appear to present testimony before Congress in matters related to their duties to the President.</p>
    <p>Therefore, because of Dr. Kissinger’s position on the immediate staff of the President your invitation to appear before the Committee must respectfully be declined. We hope, however, that the Committee will be able to meet informally with Dr. Kissinger at an early opportunity.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>WILLIAM E. TIMMONS,<br><i>Assistant to the President.</i></p>
