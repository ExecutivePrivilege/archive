    <p>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,<br>SUBCOMMITTEE ON FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND GOVERNMENT INFORMATION,<br>COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS,<br><i>Washington, D.C., February 11, 1972.</i></p>
    <p>Hon. HERBERT G. KLEIN,<br><i>Director of Communications,</i><br><i>The White House, Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>Dear Mr. Klein: Early next month the Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee will begin a comprehensive series of hearings into the administration and effectiveness of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). A copy of the Committee's press release announcing these hearings is enclosed.</p>
    <p>The hearings will begin with panel discussions by leading experts in the fields of Government information policies and practices, in the legal ramifications of subject areas covered by the Act, and in the importance of the free flow of information about the activities of the Federal government to help inform our citizens.</p>
    <p>On behalf of the Members of the Subcommittee, we would like to extend this invitation to you to participate in our panel discussion of experts in the field of Government information policies, practices, and problem areas in dealing with the public, the media, the internal agency bureaucracy, and the Congress.</p>
    <p><b>[*441]</b> This panel will be heard on Monday, March 6, at 10:00 a.m. in Room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building. We hope, that initial statements by each panelist could be limited to 10 minutes, to be followed by general discussion among the panel members and questioning by Subcommittee Members.</p>
    <p>Because of the vital importance of these hearings and your own valuable experience in the field, we earnestly hope that it will be possible for you to arrange your schedule to appear. Please let us know at the earliest date if you can participate in our hearings. If there are questions, please contact the Subcommittee Staff Director, William G. Phillipsâ€”(202) 225-3741.</p>
    <p>With best regards,<br>Sincerely,<br>WILLIAM S. MOORHEAD,<br><i>Chairman.</i></p>
