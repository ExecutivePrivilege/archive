    <p><i>Dear Mr. Chairman:</i></p>
    <p>This letter is to confirm the fact, stated to your Committee today by Mr. Alexander Butterfield, that the President's meetings and conversations in the White House have been recorded since the spring of 1971.</p>
    <p>I am advised that this system, which is still in use, is similar to that employed by the last Administration and which had been discontinued from 1969 until the spring of 1971.</p>
    <p>A more detailed statement concerning these procedures will be furnished to the Committee shortly.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>J. Fred Buzhardt</p>
