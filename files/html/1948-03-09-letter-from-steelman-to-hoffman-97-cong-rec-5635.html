    <p>My Dear Mr. Congressman: I am returning to you herewith two subpenas recently issued to me on behalf of your subcommittee. On Saturday, March 6, I received a subpena calling for my attendance at a hearing to be held that afternoon. On Monday, March 8, I received another subpena calling for my attendance at a hearing to be held the same day.</p>
    <p>As you know, my official duties are to advise and assist the President of the United States. After the receipt of each of these subpenas, I promptly informed the President, and in each instance the President directed me in view of my duties as his assistant, not to appear before your subcommittee.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sincerely yours,<br>John R. Steelman<br><i>The Assistant to the President</i></p>
