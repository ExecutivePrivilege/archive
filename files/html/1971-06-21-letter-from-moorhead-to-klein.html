    <p>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,<br>SUBCOMMITTEE ON FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND GOVERNMENT INFORMATION,<br>COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS,<br><i>Washington, D.C., June 21, 1971.</i></p>
    <p>Hon. HERBERT G. KLEIN,<br><i>Director of Communications for the Executive Branch, Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>DEAR MR. KLEIN: The Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee has scheduled a series of hearings to begin Wednesday, June 23, 1971, on U.S. Government information policies and practices.</p>
    <p>Pursuant to the Subcommittee's legislative and investigative authority over Government information subjects, we will explore the Constitutional principles and operational practices involved in the public "right to know" and the right of the Legislative Branch to information and documents from the Executive Branch that are deemed essential in the discharge of our duties as elected representatives of the American people.</p>
    <p><b>[*440]</b> You are hereby requested to appear before the Subcommittee as a witness at 10:00 a.m., Wednesday, June 30, 1971 in Room 2247, Rayburn House Office Building. Your vast experience in the news field and the unique position you now hold in the present Administration will make your testimony particularly valuable to the Subcommittee.</p>
    <p>In addition to your general views and comments on the broad scope of our inquiry, please be prepared to discuss the ways in which your office functions in its coordinating role in the dissemination of information to the public generally and what role your office plays in coordinating request for both routine and classified material by Congress.</p>
    <p>Please be prepared to discuss also the extent of Executive compliance with the instructions issued by President Nixon on April 7, 1969 establishing procedures in the handling of Congressional demands for information. Please explain also what role your office has in enforcing the procedures set forth in that April 7, 1969 Memorandum.</p>
    <p>With best regards,<br>Sincerely,<br>WILLIAM S. MOORHEAD,<br><i>Chairman.</i></p>
