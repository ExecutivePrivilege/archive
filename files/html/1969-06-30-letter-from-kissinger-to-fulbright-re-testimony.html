    <p>THE WHITE HOUSE,<br><i>Washington, D.C., June 30, 1969.</i></p>
    <p>Hon. J. W. FULBRIGHT,<br><i>U.S. Senate,</i><br><i>Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>Dear SENATOR FULBRIGHT: I have carefully considered the request in your <a href="/archive/files/html/1969-06-26-letter-from-fulbright-to-kissinger.html">letter of June 26</a> that I meet informally in executive session with the Committee on Foreign Relations. I have concluded that the nature of my position and the necessary traditions which have been established to insure that the Presidentâ€™s staff can serve him effectively preclude me from accepting your invitation.</p>
    <p>Best regards,<br>HENRY A. KISSINGER.</p>
    <p>[P.S.] I am of course always happy to meet you on a personal basis.</p>
