    <p>U.S. SENATE,<br>COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS,<br><i>Washington D.C., February 10, 1972.</i></p>
    <p>Hon. HENRY A. KISSINGER,<br><i>Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, The White House, Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>DEAR HENRY: In view of the wide public exposure you have received as a result of your recent press and television briefings, I wondered whether you might wish to reconsider your earlier reluctance to appear before the Committee on Foreign Relations. I doubt that the Founding Fathers contemplated that the Executive and Legislative branches should exchange views on foreign policy by reading press accounts.</p>
    <p>Sincerely yours,<br>J. W. FULBRIGHT,<br><i>Chairman.</i></p>
