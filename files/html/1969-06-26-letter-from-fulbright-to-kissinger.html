    <p>U.S. SENATE,<br>COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS,<br><i>June 26, 1969.</i></p>
    <p>Hon. HENRY A. KISSINGER,<br><i>Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, The White House.</i></p>
    <p>Dear DR. KISSINGER:</p>
    <p>I wonder if you would be willing to meet with the Committee on Foreign Relations informally and in executive session for a general review of major foreign policy questions. I think that such a meeting would be most beneficial to the Committee, for we would then have a much clearer idea of the new Administrationâ€™s objectives and intentions.</p>
    <p>Sincerely yours,<br>J. W. FULBRIGHT, <i>Chairman</i>.</p>
