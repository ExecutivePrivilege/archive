    <p>U.S. SENATE,<br>COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS,<br><i>February 2, 1971.</i></p>
    <p>MR. JOHN LEHMAN, JR.,<br><i>National Security Council,</i><br><i>Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>Dear Mr. Lehman: In the meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee this morning, there was discussion of the Washington Post story (copy attached) concerning your remarks January 27 at an off-the-record meeting of Senate staff members and Foreign Service Officers. It was noted, that you were quoted as saying the reports of the discussions had been taken out of context.</p>
    <p>The Committee agreed that, in order to clarify this matter further, you should be requested to meet with the Committee in Executive Session tomorrow afternoon Wednesday, February 3, at 2:30 o'clock in Room S-116 of the Capitol.</p>
    <p>The Committee also took note of the fact that the remarks in question were made to representatives of both the Executive and Legislative Branches in a meeting not involving your official relationship to the President and therefore beyond the scope of Executive Privilege.</p>
    <p>Sincerely yours,<br>J. W. FULBRIGHT,<br><i>Chairman.</i></p>
