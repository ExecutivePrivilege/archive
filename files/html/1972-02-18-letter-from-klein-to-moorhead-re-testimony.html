    <p>THE WHITE HOUSE,<br><i>Washington, February 18, 1972.</i></p>
    <p>Hon. WILLIAM S. MOORHEAD,<br><i>Chairman, Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee, Committee on Government Operations, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your letter of <a href="/archive/files/html/1972-02-11-letter-from-moorhead-to-klein.html">February 11, 1972</a> inviting me to appear before the Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee and to participate in its hearings on the administration and effectiveness of the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
    <p>As a matter of long established principle and precedent, members of the Presidentâ€™s immediate staff do not appear before Congressional committees to testify or to participate in discussions in regard to the performance of their duties on behalf of the President. This practice is, indeed, fundamental to the operation of our system of government. Therefore, I must respectfully decline your invitation.</p>
    <p>With best regards,<br>Sincerely,<br>HERBERT G. KLEIN,<br><i>Director of Communications for the Executive Branch.</i></p>
