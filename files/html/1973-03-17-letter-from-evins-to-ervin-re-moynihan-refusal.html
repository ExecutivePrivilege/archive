    <p>CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,<br>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,<br><i>Washington, D.C., March 17, 1973.</i></p>
    <p>Hon. SAM J. ERVIN, JR.,<br><i>Chairman, Subcommittee on Separation of Powers, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>Dear Chairman Ervin: In response to your recent letter requesting information concerning the refusal of the Executive officers or employees to testify before Congressional Committees and Subcommittees, I want to provide you with the following information.</p>
    <p>On one occasion Patrick Moynihan, a Presidential assistant, declined, after an invitation by the Chairman, to testify at a formal hearing of the Subcommittee on Independent Offices Appropriations, although he later agreed to participate in an informal session if his testimony were not recorded and not given under oath.</p>
    <p>I trust this information will be of some helpfulness to you, and I want to again commend you for your great work in endeavoring to strengthen and restore the powers and prerogatives of Congress.</p>
    <p>With kindest regards and best wishes, I am,<br>Sincerely your friend,<br>JOE L. EVINS,<br><i>Member of Congress.</i></p>
