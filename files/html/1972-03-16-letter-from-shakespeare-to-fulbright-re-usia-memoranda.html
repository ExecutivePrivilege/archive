    <p>U.S. Information Agency,<br><i>Washington, D.C., March 16, 1972.</i></p>
    <p>Hon. J. William Fulbright,<br><i>Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.</i></p>
    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman: In response to your letter of March 1, I am enclosing herewith the President's directive dated March 15 from which you will note that I am unable to comply with your request for the USIA Country Program Memoranda and associated planning documents. I find that the material you request clearly falls within the scope of the President's directive.</p>
    <p>My staff and I have carefully examined the so-called Country Program Memoranda and find that, for the most part, these are planning or working documents subject to subsequent discussion and final approval. These documents are under constant review, and programs are changed in the light of changing developments in Washington and in the host countries.</p>
    <p>You will note from the President's directive that he wishes the Administration to be wholly responsive to Congressional requests subject only to restrictions neces- sary for the proper functioning of the Executive Department.</p>
    <p>With this objective in view, I shall be happy to supply your Committee with summaries of the approved country objectives together with a description of the activities proposed to implement them. Also, our key officers, including myself and the Assistant Directors for each geographic area, are ready to provide your staff with country-by-country briefings as well as being available at all times for questioning by you and your colleagues.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Frank Shakespeare.</p>
