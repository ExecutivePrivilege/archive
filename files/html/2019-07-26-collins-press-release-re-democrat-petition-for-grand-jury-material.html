    <p>WASHINGTON — Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, released the following statement in response to Democrats’ petition to access grand jury information from the special counsel investigation.</p>
    <p><b>“Judiciary Democrats are suing for grand jury material to which they have no right. The D.C. Circuit Court reaffirmed earlier this year that judges lack the authority to make exceptions to the rules authorizing access to grand jury material. Three Democrat witnesses recently affirmed that it would be illegal for the attorney general to share that material with the majority. Two days ago, the special counsel himself testified that he knows of no attorney general who has ever gone to court to support such a request.</b></p>
    <p><b>“Chairman Nadler’s legal action here is sure to fail, weakening Congress’s ability to conduct oversight now and into the future. If my colleagues want grand jury information, they should propose legislation allowing Congress to access it. Democrats want to convince their base they’re still wedded to impeachment even after this week’s hearing, but a baseless legal claim is an odd way to show that.”</b></p>
